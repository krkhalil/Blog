"The New Datastream Aggregators, FriendFeed and Standards","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.friendfeed.com"">FriendFeed</a> is an example of a new type of aggregator where multiple data types, or streams, for a user can be bought together. The difference between this new type of aggregator and the standard RSS feed-reader type of aggregator is that the later does a good job of supporting a set of formats that are almost standard, while the new aggregators such as FriendFeed are building in app-specific support.</p>, <p>The disadvantages of this model are that only the selected applications can participate in the aggregator and network, a disadvantage to smaller providers and a position that would only cement the place of the more popular services. In addition, service-specific API support would not scale very well, as every API update and nuance would have to be tracked, maintained and debugged.</p>, <p>A very important issue is how feed and data types should be standardized to allow all application providers to participate in aggregator ecosystems such as FriendFeed, rather than just the 41 selected and supported.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/friendfeed""><img class=""shot"" src=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/friendfeed.jpg"" style=""float:left;""/></a></p>, <p>The 41 services provided are just feeds, be it plain descriptive XML or RSS or Atom or some variation thereof, they are effectively feeds of varying data types. They can be easily broken down into the different categories and hence data types – such as link feeds, content feeds, image feeds, event feeds etc. etc. Currently each application API developer implements what they feel is a good format for an API (and often poorly) and it is often very different to what similar applications provide.</p>, <p>With generic feed standards, either through the use of Microformats or the use of defined namespace extensions, it would level the field so that any application or service can participate rather than those that are popular amongst the digerati. Imagine if the earliest news feed readers only supported a set of 41 sites? So you wouldn’t even be able to subscribe to your own blog, let alone the blog of a friend or colleague.</p>, <p>For some reason, outside of content feeds (blog RSS feeds), the other formats have developed in a sporadic and non-standard manner. The standardization of feeds around data types has almost reached a point of becoming an urgent priority, as the mechanisms that previously worked well in defining standard formats broke down with the new types of shared media.</p>, <p>FriendFeed recognize the problems and have commited to supporting the Media RSS standards, but Bret from FriendFeed also said that opening up the aggregator could result in more noise and spam which would drive away users. I believe that the problem may be overstated, and a subscription-based model effectively results in pure, chosen content.</p>, <p>Either way, the next messaging or photo sharing application being built should be able to build an API based on a standard spec for each data type. While there are plenty of new standard format efforts (and new efforts seem to launch every other day), there hasn’t been a best practice decision made by the key influencers (eg. FriendFeed – a bigger stream aggregator) and developers to force the issue.</p>, <p>This could be solved by a large-scale web services proxy, but it would be better if format proxying was only an interim solution.</p>]"
SproutCore: The New Javascript Rich Internet Platform,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">Steve Gillmor and I met with Peter and <a href=""http://www.okito.net/"">Charles</a> of <a href=""http://www.sproutcore.com/"">SproutCore</a>, the open source javascript framework for web application development. The platform has recently attracted a lot of attention as it was revealed that it powered the <a href=""http://www.apple.com/mobileme/"">Apple Mobile Me</a> web application demos from this years <a href=""developer.apple.com/wwdc/ "">WWDC keynote</a>.</p>, <p><a href=""http://qik.com/player.swf?streamname=435d1dc44f374d19933fc6fae02fbff4&amp;vid=108030&amp;playback=false&amp;polling=false&amp;user=stevegillmor&amp;userlock=true&amp;islive=&amp;username=anonymous"">http://qik.com/player.swf?streamname=435d1dc44f374d19933fc6fae02fbff4&amp;vid=108030&amp;playback=false&amp;polling=false&amp;user=stevegillmor&amp;userlock=true&amp;islive=&amp;username=anonymous</a></p>, <p>SproutCore was developed during the development of a new version of their <a href=""http://www.sproutit.com"">SproutIT</a> product, a support desk email management product. Development commenced in early 2007, and was a response to the lack of a complete and full Javascript development platform. Most browser Javascript developers make use of multiple libraries to accomplish simple interface and computing tasks, while SproutCore aims to provide a complete platform more akin to Flash or Silverlight.</p>, <p>SproutCore has been designed and implemented so that the interfaces and libraries are similar to the Cocoa development platform used on Mac OS X. This was a decision made by the developers as they believed that not only is Cocoa a well-designed platform, but that in developing a web application platform in the same way, it would open the doors of web application development to many traditional Mac desktop app developers.</p>]"
Piczo Announces Itself to the UK,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.piczo.com""><img class=""right"" src=""http://static.flickr.com/62/223580052_3f849b882e_o.jpg""/></a>Social networking site <a href=""http://www.piczo.com"">Piczo</a>, is on a UK press tour this week and is releasing some interesting statistics on its worldwide and UK-based usage.</p>, <p>Piczo was founded in early 2004 as a paid service. Based on early user feedback it was relaunched as a free service, and founder Jim Conning sent out 100 emails to Canadian teenagers announcing the new site. That is where Piczo’s marketing efforts began and, until now, ended. The result of those 100 emails has been a massive viral spread of the product…today Piczo has 10 million monthly unique visitors that generate about 2.5 billion page views. According to Comscore, <strong>59% of the UK teen Internet audience visited Piczo in June 2006.</strong></p>, <p>Piczo is a Myspace or Bebo type social network, but targets a significantly younger demographic – 75% of Piczo users are between 13 and 16 years old. And unlike Myspace, Piczo is focused on safety first. It is virtually impossible to browse user pages on Piczo. There is no search or browse feature. Users must share their page URL with others for it to be found, and there are numerous ways for users, parents and others to report inappropriate behavior. Piczo has full time staff reviewing all complaints and takes swift action to protect its members.</p>, <p><img class=""left"" src=""http://static.flickr.com/83/223580050_82e45940b5_o.jpg""/>CEO Jeremy Verba says Piczo is “like a house party, where you invite your friends over and listen to music,” whereas “Myspace is more like a club…it’s for an older crowd, and you can’t necessarily control who they let in”. It’s an apt description, and visitors to the site definitely see a much tamer, less chaotic atmosphere compared to the other social networks.</p>, <p>Piczo is well funded after pocketing a total of US$7 million over two rounds of financing from <a href=""http://www.sierraventures.com/"">Sierra Ventures</a> and <a href=""http://www.catamountventures.com/"">Catamount</a> in 2005 and 2006. At this point, the company is looking to aggresively expand its international userbase and increase revenues.</p>, <p>Piczo is the fifth largest social network after Myspace, Facebook, Bebo and Tagged based on U.S. Comscore data, but boasts being the largest UK teen site and the third largest UK community site overall.</p>, <p>As part of the press tour, Piczo is also announcing that they will hire a UK based management team to manage operations here.</p>]"

BackPack Profile,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><strong>Company:</strong> <a href=""http://www.backpackit.com"">BackPack</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/backpacklogo.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>BackPack launched in early May 2005, and it is one of the defining web 2.0 applications.</p>, <p>BackPack does one thing very, very well – organize your personal information online. It has a basic package that is free, and it is one of the first applications built on <a href=""http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php"">AJAX</a> and <a href=""http://www.rubyonrails.org/"">Ruby on Rails</a>. If you aren’t familiar with these development platforms, all you need to know is that data transfers and page updates occur without submitting and refreshing, it is lightning fast and there are NO client downloads to deal with. BackPack is a perfect use of these emerging development technologies. To understand how this technology kicks web 1.0 in the pants, just compare it to Microsoft’s <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/office/onenote/prodinfo/default.mspx"">One Note</a> (which I used for about 10 minutes before never opening again).</p>, <p>At its core BackPack is an information management tool. It is one of the showcase applications created by <a href=""http://www.37signals.com/"">37 Signals</a>, along with <a href=""http://www.basecamphq.com/"">Basecamp </a>(“Project Management Utopia”) and <a href=""http://www.tadalist.com/"">Ta-Da Lists</a> (“Make Lists and Get Stuff Done”).</p>, <p>In their own words, <em>“â€œWe call it useful” Some have called Backpack “a wiki with out the wacky.” Others have called it “blogish.” Others have said it’s a project management tool for all the little things in your life. Some say it’s a application that helps you get things done. Some have called it Basecamp’s little brother. Call it what you will. We call it useful and hope you do too.<br/>
Last but most: Clear, Simple, and Fast. At the heart of Backpack is simplicity and clarity. Things work the way you’d expect them to work. Everything complex has been tossed so the tool is simple to the core. In fact, nothing takes more than a few seconds. Our “Ajaxed” interface elements eliminate reloading hassles. Backpack gives you the benefit of the web (centralized access, no install, no IT nightmares) without the downsides of the web (reloads, slowdowns, poor interfaces). Information management on the web has finally been realized. Backpack it.ï¿½?</em></p>, <p>There are a number of suggested uses, with screenshots <a href=""http://www.backpackit.com/examples/#a000149"">here</a> . In our opinion, the key uses are to create pages of to do lists, planning for trips or events, taking and updating notes on products, etc. The great thing about it is how easy it is to create a new page, and add text and files, including images. You can share those pages with friends or the whole world. After you create pages, you can group them in any way you think is appropriate. There are no mandatory fields, complex multi-step processes, or specialized “buckets” for data.</p>, <p><strong>Pricing: </strong>A basic account is free. Upgraded accounts have a monthly fee of $5, $9, or $19 (see the last screen shot below) (more $ = more storage and more reminders). You need at least the $5/month option to get some file storage space.</p>, <p><strong>Features:</strong></p>, <p>– Home page to easily manage all sub-pages<br/>
– Easy to make new pages<br/>
– Easy to add content to a page â€“ links, notes, files, images, etc.<br/>
– Set reminder feature, with reminders via email, sms or RSS<br/>
– Tagging of pages<br/>
– Sharing of pages (public or just friends)<br/>
– email pages<br/>
– email data to a page (like posting a picture to <a href=""http://www.flickr.com"">flickr</a> with a cameraphone)</p>, <p><strong>Screen Shots:</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/backpack1061205.gif""/><br/>

<strong><br/>
What is it?</strong></p>, <p>At first glance this looks sort of like a search engine or something, but its not. It is way neater than that. YubNub is a “command line for the web” and was built with <a href=""http://rubyonrails.org"">Ruby on Rails</a>. What this means is that you can access web applications (like google, amazon, and everything else) via the command box on YubNub’s website. A command consists of at least two pieces of information – an application identifier and a specific command.</p>, <p>For instance, if you type in “flkall ireland”, YubNub will redirect you to the flickr website and show pictures with the tag “ireland”.</p>, <p>There are a <a href=""http://yubnub.org/kernel/ls?args="">ton of commands available</a> and functionality to <a href=""http://yubnub.org/command/new?name="">create</a> new ones directly by users.</p>, <p>You can also use YubHub as a <a href=""http://yubnub.org/documentation/describe_installation"">Firefox extension and other ways</a>.<br/>
<strong><br/>
Favorite Commands:</strong></p>, <p>flkall – shows flickr phots with all tags entered<br/>
GMT – find local time and date in entered location<br/>
mini – turn a long URL into a short one using minilink.org<br/>
pod – search for podcasts on Podcast Alley.<br/>
quote – get a stock quote, just enter the symbol<br/>
say – to “say” everything entered after “say” <a href=""http://yubnub.org/example/tts?args=TechCrunch+is+the+most+awesome+of+everything+awesome+on+the+web+there+is+nothing+better+than+techcrunch"">Example</a><br/>
An alias for “tts”<br/>
areacode – Lookup a city by area code. US only. Thx Verizon.<br/>
jobs – Performs a search at Indeed.com for available jobs that include the keywords provided.<br/>

<strong><br/>
What is it?</strong></p>, <p>Odeo will be a a podcast service that lets users search, find, and subscribe to podcasts, as well as a tool to create your own podcasts with minimal hardware. Odeo is built on <a href=""http://www.rubyonrails.org"" target=""_blank"">Rails</a>.</p>, <p>In their own words, <em>“Hi. We’re Odeo (pronounced like rodeo). Somewhere in an apartment in San Francisco, we’re making it easy for you to discover, create, and subscribe to fresh, independent audio content for your iPod (or whatever MP3-player-type-deal you prefer).”</em></p>, <p>There isn’t much to see yet because their product is only available via an invitation-only beta. However, there are a couple of people who’ve tested the product and have blogged on it.</p>, <p>From <a href=""http://webreakstuff.com/blog/2005/06/the-rodeo-thoughts-on-odeo/"" target=""_blank"">webreakstuff</a>:</p>, <p><em>“They make it easy to subscribe to audio content of your preference by browsing categories, and check what everybody else is listening to. Additionally, they allow someone to add any show thatâ€™s not in the system yet, and if youâ€™re actually the publisher of a current channel, Odeo makes it easy for you to take control and customize it.</em></p>, <p>Unfortunately the Odeo Studio feature isn’t up yet. Odeo Studio is, and I quote, a browser-based tool that makes it easy to record and publish. With the Studio, and a cheap microphone (or even the one built into your laptop), you have everything you need. Thats interesting, and if they do things right, that may be the feature that gives them the edge I was talking about on my previous post about Odeo and iTunes. We’ll have to wait and see.<br/>
I like how the overview page (the entry page to Odeo) lists featured content, the Zeitgeist (what people are listening to right now) and Odeo news.”</p>, <p>It looks like Odeo will also support tagging of content, which will be a crucial way to find good stuff – audio, unlike text, is hard to preview and so metadata is even more necessary.</p>, <p><strong>Screen Shots:</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/odeo1061305.jpg""/><br/>

</a><br/>
<strong>Status:</strong> <a href=""http://www.snocap.com/press/releases/?id=6"">Launched June 13, 2005</a></p>, <p><strong>Founded:</strong> September, 2002</p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>Snocap allows those who own rights to music to place them onto p2p networks and retail sites with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Rights_Management"">DRM</a>. This means that, through Snocap, music can theoretically be controlled (charged for and copies restricted) and still leverage the extremely popular p2p sites for distribution. It was founded by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Fanning"">Shawn Fanning</a>, the creator of the original Napster p2p filesharing network in 1999.</p>, <p>The current business models for selling music include iTunes (pay per download) and subscription services like Yahoo, Napster and Rhapsody that allow you to listen to, and download, anything and everything in their catalog for a monthly subscription fee ranging from $5 – $20 per month currently.</p>, <p>Snocap does things differently. They are decentralized and therefore do not require, or even provide, a centralized service for downloading music. Rather, they have focused on the platform and relationships with labels.</p>, <p>Current label partners include: Universal Music Group, SONY BMG MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT, EMI, Absolutely Kosher Records, Artemis Records/Sheridan Square Entertainment, Digital Musicworks International, IDEA Distributors, I AM Music and Entertainment, Gammon Records, Independent Online Distribution Alliance, Kufala, Streetbeat Records / Pandisc / Kriztal Entertainment, Nacional Records, Nettwerk Records, OM Records/Deep Concentration, One Little Indian, Psychobaby Reality Entertainment, Ryko Group, Six Degrees, SSDD and TVT Records.</p>, <p>Snocap allows labels to charge for music (snocap will take a cut ranging from 0% – 2.5% of the fee charged by the labels). They also charge labels for premium accounts give increased functionality and reporting.</p>, <p><strong>Services to Labels:</strong></p>, <p>– allowslabels and individual artists to embrace peer-to-peer networks as a safe and secure distribution channel.<br/>
– one-stop access to clear rights and manage online distribution across retail destinations.<br/>
 – ability to maintain full control of content by determining business rules and setting pricing and usage terms.<br/>
– accounting and reporting services<br/>
– method for independent artists to distribute and sell their music</p>, <p><strong>Services to P2P and Retail sites:</strong></p>, <p>– centralized access point for all their licensing needs.<br/>
– ability to sell music from the vast selection of music now only available on file-sharing networks.<br/>
– incremental revenues from live, remixed and out-of-print works<br/>
– reduced costs by eliminating the need to maintain relationships with thousands of copyright holders</p>, <p><strong>Screen Shots:</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/snocap1061405.gif""/><br/>

FeedBurner Profile,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><strong>Company:</strong> <a href=""http://www.feedburner.com"">FeedBurner</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/feedburnerlogo.jpg""/></p>, <p><strong>Location:</strong> Chicago</p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>FeedBurner is a service that takes a normal, everyday RSS or Atom feed of any kind and turns (burns)  it into a <em>FeedBurner</em> feed that you can then distribute to readers for use in any RSS reader. The company currently hosts more than 60,000 combined RSS and Atom feeds for over 40,000 content publishers. The company’s hosted service currently processes over 5 million daily views of RSS content including podcasts and video weblogs.</p>, <p>One reason a blog or website owner would want to use this is because it simplifies the RSS feed. The Feed URL for Techcrunch, for instance, is “http://feeds.feedburner.com/Techcrunch”, which is a much simpler format that standard RSS feeds. Also, most blogging software offers a variety of RSS feeds – Atom, RSS 1.0, 2.0, etc. Sometimes these feeds don’t work properly with some readers. And if a site can get most of its readers to use the single Feedburner feed, they can take advantage of the great statistics and tools to see where readers are coming from and what they are clicking on.</p>, <p>FeedBurner offers two services – a free version and a Pro version that costs between $5-$16 per month depending on the number of feeds managed. The stats for the free version are great, and the pro version also shows more detail and a “who’s syndicating me” feature. The Pro version has a 15 day free trial.</p>, <p>The big reason for using FeedBurner, however, is that it can automatically add Google Adsense adds to your feeds, allowing you to easily generate revenue if you have a large enough audience. There are a number of influential bloggers who don’t like this service, however (and other aspects of FeedBurner as well) – see Relevant Links below for more information.</p>, <p>One drawback to FeedBurner was the difficulty in turning it off and moving your feeds off the network (while retaining your audience). The method for doing this was complicated and clunky (or required you run your site from your own server) and so many top bloggers stayed away from their service.</p>, <p>However, on June 10, 2005 FeedBurner <a href=""http://www.burningdoor.com/feedburner/archives/001251.html"">announced</a> (this is the FeedBurner blog)  a new feature to allow easy transition away from FeedBurner whilst retaining your readers. Nice move.</p>, <p>So FeedBurner offers ease of use, great stats, revenue AND a relatively painless way out. Thumbs up from TechCrunch <strong>and that’s why we use them</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>, <p>– very easy to use<br/>
– nice URL string for the feed<br/>
– generate revenue from RSS ads<br/>
– RSS page isn’t just xml code, it has a nice look/feel<br/>
– great stats for your feeds<br/>
– easy transition out of FeedBurner if you ever want to leave</p>, <p><strong>Screen Shots:</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/feedburner1061305.gif""/><br/>

Profile – PubSub,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><strong>Company:</strong> <a href=""http://www.pubsub.com"">PubSub</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/pubsublogo.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Location: </strong>New York</p>, <p><strong>Launched:</strong> February 9, 2004</p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>PubSub, which is short for “publish and subscribe”, is a future search engine. It’s also called “persistent search”. Users input keywords on subjects that they are interested in. The keywords are stored, or “persistent”.  PubSub’s matching engine compares these stored/persistent queries against newly-discovered pages on an ongoing basis, in real time.</p>, <p>What this means: If you would like to be notified of websites that post about subjects you are interested in, you input the search terms, and PubSub will notifiy you as posts appear that include your keywords. A great (necessary, really) feature is the ability to store any persistent search and view it via RSS in your favorite reader. At TechCrunch, for instance, we have stored search terms like “Web 2.0” and are notified in our RSS reader of all new posts or articles that include the term “Web 2.0”.</p>, <p>People generally refer to what PubSub does as either persistent search or future search, whereas regular search engines like Google are refered to as retrospective search. Persistent search notifies you of future content as it is created. Retrospective search engines help you find content that is already out there on the web.</p>, <p>If you find it hard to get your mind around this, try it out, and make sure you take the RSS feed from your subscription so that you don’t have to go back to the site to check and see if there are any new results. As the alerts start rolling in to your RSS reader, you will be very pleasantly surprised.</p>, <p>PubSub is also very strongly behind a <a href=""http://www.structuredblogging.org"">structured blogging</a> initiative which helps bloggers structure topic-specific posts like reviews (books, music, etc.) and events. A wordpress plugin is available at <a href=""http://www.structuredblogging.org"">structuredblogging.org</a>, that we use here at TechCrunch as well as on our personal blogs.</p>, <p>We like pubsub and have many, many subscriptions to keep us up to date on topics that interest us. As an example, <a href=""http://atom.pubsub.com/43/50/aafa902a13310b7c55f2ef2bbc.xml"">here</a> is the RSS feed for our subscription to “web2.0 and web 2.0” (where we seem to consistently find great posts from a blog called the <a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/"">Read/Write Web</a>, the <em>second best </em>Web 2.0 blog on the net :-).</p>, <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>, <p>– Future or Persistent search at lightning-fast speeds (subject only to RSS time limitations)<br/>
– web based<br/>

<strong><br/>
What is it?</strong></p>, <p>vSkype is a new product launch by <a href=""http://www.viditel.com/"">Santa Cruz Networks</a> (disclaimer: <a href=""http://www.archimedesventures.com/Team.htm"">Keith Teare</a>, a partner at Archimedes Ventures, was formerly the CEO of Santa Cruz Networks).</p>, <p>vSkype is an add-on to Skype that lets you have up to <em>200 people</em> on a <em>video call</em>. We tested the software out this morning and it works very, very well. Voice and video quality was more than acceptable.</p>, <p>A bunch of video add-ons for Skype have emerged over the last few weeks, including <a href=""http://www.jyve.com/"">jyve</a> and <a href=""http://217.15.33.218/index.php?id=79"">spontania</a>. We have not tested these services yes and so cannot compare them with vSkype.</p>, <p>In their own words, <em>“How is vSkype Beta different from other Skype video plug-ins? vSkype Beta provides fast real-time video between you and all of your Skype contacts – up to 2.3 frames per second (fps) for anyone using a standard 56K modem, and up to 24 fps for anyone using DSL, a cable modem, or a corporate broadband connection like a T1 line. vSkype Beta also allows you to share display data. Any open application, or even the entire desktop, can be viewed by other participants during a vSkype Beta call. In addition, vSkype Beta’s “Add to Call” feature allows you invite other Skype contacts to your existing call. This eliminates the disruption of having to create a new call each time you would like to add new callers. With vSkype Beta it is possible for up to 200 people to participate in a single call or meeting without degrading overall performance. All those people can broadcast video at the same time, if they choose, and each participant can view any 8 people at a given time.” </em></p>, <p><em>“vSkype Beta allows users to securely conduct video calls in groups from 2 to 200 and share applications, spreadsheets, presentations, or photos with others on a call. In future releases users will be able to download and play Santa Cruz Networkâ€™s games with other Skype users and access our library of camera personalities, wallpaper, and drawing tools. Professional users will be provided with various call controls, white boarding, meeting moderation, bandwidth control, and recording and archiving tools through our network of partners.”</em></p>, <p><a href=""http://gigaom.com/2005/06/15/video-calls-come-to-skype/"">Om Malik</a> has a great comment on vSkype: <em>“This cannot be good for NetMeeting or Web-Ex, which will have tough time competing with a much lower cost offerings. I think this product has a good chance of becoming a major enterprise play.”</em></p>, <p>Given that both of these companies share <a href=""http://www.dfj.com/"">Draper Fisher Jurvetson</a> as an investor, I would not be surprised if an acquisition is coming.</p>, <p><strong><br/>

Profile – Talkr,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><strong>Company:</strong> <a href=""http://www.talkr.com"">Talkr</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/talkr_logo.jpg""/></p>, <p><strong>Location:</strong> New Hampshire</p>, <p><strong>Launch Date:</strong> April 18, 2005<br/>
<strong><br/>
What is it?</strong></p>, <p>Talkr is a site/service that converts text feeds directly into audio files. For instance, to listen to this post, click <a href=""http://www.talkr.com/app/fetch.app?feed_id=1293&amp;perma_link=http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=20"">here</a>.</p>, <p>As a blogger, signing up is relatively simply. Steps:</p>, <p>1. Make a request at the site <a href=""http://www.talkr.com/app/partners_inquiry.app"">here</a><br/>
2. They quickly send a follow up email, with a link to a <a href=""http://www.talkr.com/company/terms_of_service.htm"">user agreement</a> that you must physically sign and fax or send back to them. The agreement allows them to place ads into the audio, so that is another potential revenue source for them (and I’m fine with that since they aren’t charging me for the service)<br/>
3. Once you return the documents, they send another email with directions on setting it up at your blog. This consists of adding an html snippet (note the talkr gif under our xml gifs at the top of our sidebar. You also have a URL structure to allow any post to be listened to – See above for the audio of this post. The audio can be downloaded as an MP3 file as well.</p>, <p>As a listener, there is fairly deep content to scroll through, and you can add any other blog you like (up to three for free). Given that they have only been live for a month, the content is actually quite good (heck, it includes Techcrunch :-) ). There is both search and browse capability, and there are links to a few on the home page to allow easy testing of the service.</p>, <p>The recording is automated, but good quality. The main problem is that you lose hyperlinks and images.</p>, <p>In their own words, <em>“Talkr provides a service that allows you to listen to your favorite text-only news sources rather than read them. If you can point us to an RSS feed (a machine-readable version of your favorite blog or news source) we will convert that feed from text to speech. Talkr can also provide you with a podcast of your favorite news sources. This means that you can plug your MP3 player into your home computer once a day and Talkr will provide you with hours of audio content with no additional work on your part. Talkr will keep tabs on your feeds and send audio to your computer as those audio files become available.<br/>
Does this cost money? Well, yes and no (mostly no). Talkr has partnered with several of the most widely read blogs on the internet to provide an audio version of those blogs for free. In addition, if you sign up for a free membership, you can listen to up to three additional blogs for free.  If you want to listen to more than 3 feeds (plus all the free ones), we ask that you sign up for one of our monthly subscriptions: Talkr Basic or Talkr Premium.”</em></p>, <p>For listeners, there is a free version, Talkr Basic for $5/month and Talkr Premium for $8/month</p>, <p>I like this service and there may be some “there” there, as Keith always says.</p>, <p><strong>Screen Shot:</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/talkr1061506.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Management:</strong></p>, <p>Chris Brooks, CEO</p>, <p><strong>Relevant Links:</strong></p>, <p><a href=""http://whistlefish.blogspot.com/"">Talkr Blog</a><br/>

It was created by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Schachter"">Joshua Schachter</a>.</p>, <p>Delicious made tagging popular.</p>, <p>It is an open-bookmarking service with tagging. You tag your bookmarks (any URI, meaning a web page or a single blog post), which helps you organize the data. The exceptionally cool thing about delicious is that you can view the data that others have tagged in many different ways.</p>, <p>There are tools you can add to your browser, etc. to easily tag URIs as you view them. The second screen shot below shows this in action</p>, <p>For instance. <a href=""http://del.icio.us/marrington"">deli.cio.us/marrington</a> shows all the delicious tags I’ve ever created. Likewise, <a href=""http://del.icio.us/joshua"">del.icio.us/joshua</a> shows all of the tags created by Josh Schachter, the founder.</p>, <p>You can also view the data by tags. <a href=""http://del.icio.us/tag/techcrunch"">del.icio.us/techcrunch</a> shows all techcrunch tags added by users. Replace “techcrunch” in the URL with anything else and see the results. You can also view popular tags at <a href=""http://del.icio.us/popular/"">del.icio.us/popular</a>. And so on.</p>, <p>RSS feeds are available for any search/browse string, so monitoring new tags is a snap.</p>, <p>Every day, people find new ways to use delicious.</p>, <p>In their own words, <em>“del.icio.us is a social bookmarks manager. It allows you to easily add sites you like to your personal collection of links, to categorize those sites with keywords, and to share your collection not only between your own browsers and machines, but also with others. Once you’ve registered for the service, you add a simple bookmarklet to your browser (see below). When you find a web page you’d like to add to your list, you simply select the del.icio.us bookmarklet, and you’ll be prompted for a information about the page. You can add descriptive terms to group similar links together, modify the title of the page, and add extended notes for yourself or for others. You can access your list of links from any web browser. By default, your links are shown to you in reverse chronological order, with those you’ve added most recently at the top. In addition to viewing by date, you can also view all links in a specific category (you define your own categories as you add the links), or search your links for keywords. What makes del.icio.us a social system is its ability to let you see the links that others have collected, as well as showing you who else has bookmarked a specific site. You can also view the links collected by others, and subscribe to the links of people whose lists you find interesting.”</em></p>, <p>I often refer to delicious to find pages that I’ve bookmarked.

Yes, it’s Outlook on steroids.</p>, <p>Trumba brings together Visio co-founders Jeremy Jaech and Ted Johnson with Visio CTO Peter Mullen.</p>, <p>The user interface is well thought out, easy sailing. Having Kleiner and August behind you helps you hire the best of the best, so I’m not surprised at its ease of use.</p>, <p>The signup process was one page, with a standard email confirmation required. Adding a new calendar item was a snap, and the level of detail you choose to include is up to you. Overall, it is a pleasure to use.</p>, <p>You can also create multiple calendars (think work, friends, family), and have different colors for each to keep track of them.</p>, <p>The product is not free, however. A sixty day free trial is included. After that, the price is  $39.95/year.</p>, <p>In their own words, <em>“Trumba OneCalendar is a new type of calendar service â€” a connected calendar. Trumba OneCalendar brings all of your schedules together â€” work, family, community and fun â€” into one easy-to-use calendar that keeps you connected to the people and groups you care about through events you share.”</em></p>, <p>One thing to note about open source competition: Dan Gillmor <a href=""http://bayosphere.com/blog/dangillmor/online_calendars_still_need_work"">says</a> <em>“My current hopes are on the <a href=""http://www.osafoundation.org/Chandler_Compelling_Vision.htm"">Chandler</a> project at the Open Source Applications Foundation.

Just like any other search engine. You enter a word or phrase in the input box, and weâ€™ll show you a list of results. By clicking on the (+) sign next to each result, you can select snippets of audio to help you decide whether to listen to the whole podcast or even subscribe.

Rojo’s most recent round of funding was lead by BV Capital and TPG Ventures.”</em></p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>Rojo is a web-based RSS Reader (list of all <a href=""http://allrss.com/rssreaderswebbased.html"">here</a>) that combines great “standard” RSS feader features with tagging and social networking. It is an interesting experiment that is getting a lot of buzz.</p>, <p>The service is completely free for users. It includes adds in the user interface.</p>, <p>In their own words, <em>“Rojo means “RSS with mojo” and in this spirit our company is dedicated to providing the best RSS feed reader around so that busy people can manage and read content as efficiently as possible. Our vision is that the next generation of feed reading requires new forms of organization so we built in the ability to tag your world, your content, your feeds, and even your friends. We believe that analytics and community based features are what make feed reading accessible and appealing to technophiles and new consumers alike so we provide RojoBuzz, which tracks which webpages are most linked-to by the feeds you read. With Rojo’s community features you can share stories, feeds, tags, contacts, and profile information with your friends and colleagues, making it easy to find, discover, and share interesting content. This is what we are dedicated to providing. This is what we are passionate about. “</em></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.rojo.com/register/"">Signup</a> was easy (with standard email confirmation), and I was able to import all of my feeds from bloglines (although this process could easily be simplified – I would much rather just tell them “bloglines” and my username, which some other web-based RSS readers do. Export of feeds via OPML is also offered.</p>, <p>Rojo’s magic – what makes it stand out from the crowd – is the ability to tag posts, feeds and contacts. You can use those tags to sort and find your content, but you can also use them to find other potentially useful content from others, including your contacts. Adding contacts and sharing tags and feeds is very simple. Taggin of posts and feeds also partially solves the ranking problem with blogs – it helps the cream rise to the top.</p>, <p>There are some other excellent reviews of Rojo out there and we’ve linked to many at the bottom of this post. See, for example, Jeff Clavier’s analysis <a href=""http://blog.softtechvc.com/2005/04/rojo_the_return.html"">here</a>.</p>, <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>, <p>– Free<br/>
– Web-Based<br/>
– (relatively) easy import of feeds<br/>
– export of feeds<br/>
– Feed Reading and Discovery<br/>
– Search<br/>
– Tagging<br/>

Profile: BlogAds,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><strong>Company:</strong> <a href=""http://www.blogads.com"">BlogAds</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/blogadslogo.jpg""/></p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>BlogAds is an Ad network for big blogs, and only big blogs. From their site, you generally need at least 1,000 daily readers. From their FAQs:</p>, <p><em>“What is the minimum daily user number a blog should have before they can consider blogads?<br/>
Blogs without a laser-sharp focus on one topic or community AND an audience of 1000 readers a day usually do not attract advertisers. But some blogs with a sharp focus AND an audience of thousands a day do NOT get advertisers either. One test: have more than a handful of companies expressed an interest in advertising on your blog?”</em></p>, <p>The ads are “skyscraper” format and can include images, text and a link. See the screen shots below for examples.</p>, <p>Publishers choose the blog(s) that they would like to advertise on, based on price, length and subject matter. <a href=""http://www.blogads.com/order"">Prices</a> are not CPM or CPC based – rather the ad runs for a length of time in exchange for payment. Ads may run for 1 week, or 1-3 months. Prices currently range from $10 â€“ $4500 per week.</p>, <p>Most of the top blogs use blogAds: <em>“All blogs in the top 30 have an income stream. Only one blog had no advertising or affiliate programs (it did have a donation button though).  The most popular Income Stream on these Blogs is BlogAds – 23 of the top 30 have them.”</em> <a href=""http://www.problogger.net/archives/2005/04/28/how-the-most-highly-visited-blogs-earn-money/""> Link</a><br/>
(from April 28, 2005)</p>, <p>And they seem to be making a reasonable amount of money:</p>, <p><em>“The average blogger makes $30 $50 a month selling Blogads, with some pulling up to more than $5000 monthly. As advertiser appreciation rises, your yield should rise. Blogads receives 30% of your ad fee, unlike other networks that charge far more or won’t even tell what they take.”<br/>
</em> <a href=""http://www.blogads.com/publisher_html""> Link</a></p>, <p>In fact, some blogs make the majority of their revenue from Blogads:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/blogrevenuecomparedblogads.gif""/><br/>
<a href=""http://www.mediafact.nl/weblog.php?id=P8386"">Link</a></p>, <p>Overall, it is a great and popular advertising network for bloggers with very large audiences (this is not a long tail play, at least yet). Since CPM and CPC rates are not an issue, all a blog needs is a big and relevant audience to attract advertisers, and the money rolls in.</p>, <p><strong>Screen Shots:</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/blogads1061805.gif""/><br/>

Profile: Digg,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><strong>UPDATE:</strong> More recent profile of Digg<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/07/11/profile-digg-2o/""> here</a>.</p>, <p><strong>Company:</strong> <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/digg"">Digg</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/digglogo.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>Digg is very early stage, sort of pre-beta. But its getting some buzz. Think of it as slashdot but potentially better. We first came accross it at <a href=""http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/archives/2005/06/18/why_rss_and_folksonomies_are_becoming_so_big.html"">TheShiftedLibrarian</a> and after checking out the service ourselves we were quite impressed.</p>, <p>In their own words, <em>“Digg is a technology news website that gives editorial control back to the community. Most technology websites allow users to suggest content by submitting links or stories to an editor.  If the editor believes the story to be relevant to the masses, he or she moves the story to the homepage. With digg, users also submit links for review.  But rather than allowing an editor to decide which links go on the homepage, the users do.”</em></p>, <p>Stories are first submitted by a user, along with a category. Other registered users will see the story and can “digg” it by clicking on a link. The more it is “digged”, the more popular it is and good things start to happen with the story. Once it has 15 diggs, it’s automatically moved up to the home page. As an example, we submitted our <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=17"">vskype profile</a> from a few days ago. A search of “vskype” on digg shows the story along with others <a href=""http://digg.com/search?search=vskype&amp;area=all&amp;type=both&amp;age=all&amp;submit=Submit"">here</a>.   Users can choose to digg the story, blog on it, add comments, report it as spam, etc.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/diggvskype.gif""/></p>, <p>Friends (and everyone else) can see what storied you digg by looking at the URL for your username. For instance, the stories that Techcrunch has “digged” are at <a href=""http://digg.com/users/techcrunch"">digg.com/users/techcrunch</a>. Stats for the user are also shown (and we are now determined to make ours outstanding) :-)</p>, <p><em><br/>
“User profiles are one of the most powerful features of digg.  Once logged in, digg bookmarks each story for which you have clicked ‘digg this story’. Users and friends can then browse your profile (digg.com/users/username), to see what you’ve been digging throughout the day.  Have several friends using digg? Use your favorite RSS reader or Firefox’s live bookmarks to keep track of them all. RSS feeds are available on almost all pages and user profiles throughout the site.”</em></p>, <p>There is also good, functional search:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/diggsearch.gif""/></p>, <p>Everything is available via RSS, which is a necessary feature of course. Awesome!</p>, <p>The current release is <a href=""http://digg.com/digg_news/Digg_2.0_Beta_(coming_soon)"">scheduled to be updated on June 26</a>, including a new design and new features. Currently, the site is running slow but they are dealing with the scaling issue.  Overall this is a very cool site and we are now behind it 100%. Hopefully the new release will have delicious-like toolbar options for easy post submitting.</p>, <p>We’ll definitely be coming back for a look on <a href=""http://digg.com/digg_news/Digg_2.0_Beta_(coming_soon)"">June 26 for the new 2.0 Beta</a>!</p>, <p><strong>Screen Shots:</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/digg061805_1.gif""/></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/digg061805_2.gif""/></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/digg061805_3.gif""/></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/digg061805_4.gif""/><br/>

Acquired by <a href=""http://www.looksmart.com"">Looksmart</a> on September 23, 2004</p>, <p><strong>Origin of the Name:</strong> “The origin of the name came from the very geeky description of what the system does – File URLs. If you can enter a URL and see it in your browser, we can save it for you. Once the name started being used and it was time to find a replacement, we just couldn’t come up with one we liked more. It’s short, simple and pretty easy to remember. And as an added bonus, the definition of “furl” is “to roll up and secure,” which is exactly what we do with all the interesting Web pages you find online.” <a href=""http://www.furl.net/faq.jsp"">Link</a></p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>Furl is a social bookmarking site often compared to <a href=""http://deli.cio.us"">Deli.cio.us</a> (TechCrunch review of delicious <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?cat=19"">here</a>). However, there are some key differences and many people use both obsessively.</p>, <p>At its core, once you’ve signed up with furl, if you find a site/post that you want to retain, you can “furl” it and it is saved for you. You can find the site/post later by searching for tags that you’ve associated with it (or other meta data), or by a text search.</p>, <p>If you understand delicious but are unfamiliar with Furl, the best way to describe Furl is a <em>more structured</em> delicious. There are much deeper meta data options when bookmarking a page, for instance. With delicious, currently, you can only tag a page and annotate it with notes. With Furl, you can tag it, categorize it with pre-populated items, rate it and add notes. Many Furl users like these options when tagging pages. Some users don’t need the extra data, and don’t like the time it takes to fill it out. To see this visually, here is a screen shot of a furl bookmark:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/furlmetadata.gif""/></p>, <p>Furl also does other things differently than delicious. The site you’ve bookmarked is saved at Furl (each member gets 5 gigs of storage), which means you can keep data even if the page changes. And, this allows for super-fast text searches on pages you’ve bookmarked, something delicious can’t offer. <a href=""http://battellemedia.com/"">John Battelle</a> puts it this way:</p>, <p><em>“So what is it about Furl that made me write that past paragraph? After all, it’s just a web page-saving application. Right? Well, yes and no. Furl does a good job of helping you manage your web browsing. It adds several features that others don’ t have – full text search on your saved pages, for example. But Furl saves the entire web page you’ve “furled”, not just the URL, which prevents link rot, on the one hand, and creates what I’ll call a “PersonalWeb,” on the other.” &lt;a href=""http://battellemedia.com/archives/000591.php""</em> </p>]"

For instance, my favorite weblogs, inc. blogs are <a href=""http://web20.weblogsinc.com/"">The Web 2.0 Weblog</a>, <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/"">engadget</a>, <a href=""http://www.tvsquad.com/"">tvsquad</a>, <a href=""http://rss.weblogsinc.com/"">therssweblog</a> and <a href=""http://www.cinematical.com/"">cinematical</a>. There is a list to all weblogs, inc. blogs at the <a href=""http://corporate.weblogsinc.com/"">home page</a>.</p>, <p>In their own words:<br/>
<em><br/>
“Our Philosophy In Three Parts â€” Why we are doing this?<br/>
Traditional journalism is, in a word, broken. Weâ€™ve spent the last decade working in publishing (online and offline) and we believe that traditional journalism is imploding. News outlets like the New York Times are experiencing huge embarrassments like Jayson Blair. We believe these episodes are based on the increasing pressure media companies have to watch their bottom lines, as well as the fact that these outlets do not allow user feedback. If The New York Times was formatted like a Weblog, then the subjects in Jayson Blairâ€™s stories would have been able to note the errors on The New York Timesâ€™ own Web site! Something that simple â€” empowering your readers to comment â€” could have prevented serious damage to the reputation of a respected news source.<br/>
On top of the unnecessarily one-way journalism being practiced today, the media space is suffering from the appearance of (and in some cases outright) impropriety. Do you really trust CNBC to report on their parent company GE? How did you feel when CNBC had the then CEO of GE, Jack Welch, on air all day? How do you feel when reading Time magazineâ€™s coverage of AOL? Do you really trust ABC News to report on Disney? Even if these media outlets are doing a good job, and many of them certainly are, it is difficult to believe that you are getting unbiased news when journalists are working for the companies on which they are reporting.<br/>
We believe participatory journalism is a better model than one-way journalism. Of course, participatory journalism is harder, more work and still developing as a discipline. We sincerely hope to help this field mature.<br/>
Talent wants to be free. One of the after effects of the dot com boom and bust is that many of the most talented journalists want to work for themselves. After the bust everyone realized that a) no company is loyal to them and b) that they can often make a better living on their own and have a better lifestyle.<br/>
Letâ€™s face it, working from home and having time to spend with your family, go on vacation, visit the gym in the middle of the day, and to pursue your interests is invaluable. As a journalist you get little to no security working at a big company. So if you can make the same living (or better) working independently with a better lifestyle, then why wouldnâ€™t you do that?<br/>
Partnering is better than owning. Our goal is to partner with individual bloggers, letting them do what they do best (writing, creating community, researching) and support them with what we do best (upgrading the software that drives their Web site, generating revenue, running the business). We split the profits 50/50 with each of our bloggers taking out only hard costs (i.e., sales commissions, credit card fees).<br/>
We also allow bloggers to leave our network at any time, for any reason, and take their content with them. The concept behind our agreement is that if you partner with us on a Weblog and leave a year later, you can take all your content with you and do whatever you want with it. Our only condition is that we keep our copy of the content that is already in our archive. We think this is the fairest arrangement possible and that it promotes the kind of partnership we want to have with our bloggers.”</em> <a href=""http://corporate.weblogsinc.com/entry/1016914146856668/"">Link</a></p>, <p>Weblogs, Inc. is an add supported network (banner and adsense), with adsense revenues recently <a href=""http://calacanis.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000200044559/"">reported</a> at $2,000 daily by <a href=""http://calacanis.weblogsinc.com/"">Jason Calcanis</a>, the co-founder.</p>, <p>Weblogs, Inc. is the largest blog network, with over 80 blogs and 1,000 weekly posts covering 75 industries.<a href=""http://www.nickdenton.org/"">Nick Denton</a>‘s <a href=""http://www.gawker.com/"">Gawker</a> is the second largest blog network (<a href=""http://www.wonkette.com/"">wonkette</a>, a Gawker blog, is one of my favorites).</p>, <p>They also have a “best of” site/feed <a href=""http://socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000567046844"">here</a>.</p>, <p>Weblogs, Inc. has a terrific network of blogs that we read daily.

I<em> think</em> so. If its p2p, which I imagine it would be, then it certainly is.</p>, <p>From the WSJ article: <em>“For Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., a payment service could represent a significant expansion beyond online advertising, which generated 99 percent of its $3.2 billion in revenue last year, the Journal said. Online-payment providers typically take a commission on each transaction.”</em></p>, <p>Google has a hill to climb – paypal has 72 million users (PayPal accounted for $233.1 million, or 23 percent, of eBayâ€™s revenue during the first quarter). However, they’ve done this before with search (v. everyone), advertising (v. overture) and email, although not with a social network (see <a href=""https://www.orkut.com/Login.aspx"">orkut</a> – when’s the last time you logged in?)</p>, <p>Gary Price <a href=""http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/050617-204801"">noted</a> that the company “<a href=""http://kepler.ss.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C2742364&amp;printer=yes"">Google Payment Corporation</a>” was created by Google a couple of months ago: <em>“I did a bit of research (love that deep web (-:) after reading the article and discovered that two months ago Google filed the paperwork with the California Secretary of State and formed the Google Payment Corporation. Interesting.”</em> Gary also noted that someone registered “<a href=""http://www.whois.sc/googlewallet.com"">googlewallet.com</a>“.</p>, <p>More on this as it develops.<br/>

It expands ITunes functionality to view and add podcasts directly into iTunes. This is NOT the iTunes support for podcasts announced by Steve Jobs a few weeks ago that will be included in the next version (4.9) of iTunes (and will allow for creation and charging as well). BadFruit is independent from Apple.</p>, <p>At this point, BadApple supports adding and listening to podcasts, but not creation and charging. It is a PC only product, no plug-in for Macs is yet available.</p>, <p>There is very little information on the BadApple website. Some info from the SF Chronicle though – <em>“At this point, there is no official indication of BadFruit’s origin. But a handful of signs seem to link the site to MP3Tunes.com, the online song store opened a few months ago by MP3.com founder Michael Robertson. Log files created by the software indicate that it talks to a server hosted by MP3Tunes. Code inside the software package, once downloaded, also show links to MP3Tunes. The privacy policies displayed by MP3Tunes.com and BadFruit are also identical in almost every way, with details such as the name of the company and the name of the service changed. BadFruit’s terms of use say that any legal actions concerning the software should be taken in San Diego County, where Robertson’s companies are based.”</em> <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/06/21/BUGEDDBR851.DTL&amp;feed=rss.business"">Link</a></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.whois.sc/badfruit.com"">Here</a> is the whois information for Badfruit.com</p>, <p>In their own words, <em>“Podcast support for iTunes is here! Download the free BadApple plug-in which expands the functionality and interoperability of iTunes software. (iTunes is music software which works with iPod MP3 players.) BadApple adds interoperability to view and download podcasts directly within iTunes software. There’s no need to download and learn other software programs because everything happens right in the iTunes software.</em></p>, <p>After downloading and installing BadApple, you will have a “Podcasts” link you can click on from iTunes. You can use this to browse through categories to find the Podcast you want. Each podcast has a description. Once you locate a podcast you are interested in, double clicking on the podcast will load it to your library. When you plug in your iPod the podcast will be loaded to that depending on your settings.</p>, <p>BadApple is free software. There is no charge to download the software or use the software.”</p>]"

After just two weeks, PodTech saw over 66,000 visitors, over 21,000 audio plays and 9,000 MP3 downloads (<a href=""http://furrier.typepad.com/john_furrier/2005/06/podtech_infotal.html"">Link</a>).

It’s the most popular, with NewsGator/Feeddemon a close second by number of users. If you are new to RSS, Bloglines is a very good place to start (for a complete list of web-based RSS readers, see <a href=""http://allrss.com/rssreaderswebbased.html"">here</a>).</p>, <p>Bloglines has a “two pane” format, with folders and feeds listed on the left (bolded if there are new unread entries), and content from the selected feed shown at the right. If you read content from a lot of sites, this is an excellent way to organize information. It’s also very similar  to the interface for most email applications, so its familiar to most people right from the start:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/bloglinesui062205.gif""/></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.bloglines.com/register"">Signing up</a> at Bloglines is very easy. All they ask for is an email address and password:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/bloglinessignup062205.gif""/></p>, <p>Once you are a member, you have a variety of great tools.</p>, <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>, <p>– add feeds of your favorite websites (cut and paste, or add a button to your browser toolbar to auto-add any site you are on that has a feed)<br/>
– easy import and export of feeds via opml file<br/>
– create folders to organize content<br/>
– see the number of total subscribers for any feed, and see usernames of public subscribers<br/>
– add in feeds from any other subscriber (if you like their content)</p>, <p>There is also a very neat feature that isn’t discussed very often. You can create a bloglines email address. Any email sent to this address appears within your feeds. This is a great way to move newsletters and other interesting content from your inbox to bloglines.</p>, <p>Clearly bloglines is adding tools and features to make it useful as a portal/inbox.

They have presented at <a href=""http://www.supernova2005.com/"">SuperNova</a> conference and have generated lots of discussion.</p>, <p>This is a single-sign-on solution. Think Passport, but decentralized and you don’t have to trust Microsoft to store and distribute your data. Think of this as the Verisign (domain names) of identity.</p>, <p>As a user, if you see a sxip button on a website, you can click it and give permission for sxip to transmit some of your personal data to the website instead of re-filling out those endless forms. You can create different identities with Sxip – say personal and work – and decide who gets what information. If you aren’t yet part of Sxip, you will be presented with the option of joining when you click the Sxip button.</p>, <p>What this means – if websites adopt this you will not need to fill out registration forms or have different credentials (usernames and passwords) for each of these sites.</p>, <p>Sxip is going about this the right way. The platform is based “on a network architecture similar to DNS”, and includes the following participants:</p>, <p><em>Users: </em>Registered Sxip Network users who communicate with the Network via their browser.</p>, <p><em>Homesites:</em> Websites that store user data and release it (with the user’s consent) to other websites via a browser.</p>, <p><em>Membersites:</em> Websites that request user data from Homesites via a browser.</p>, <p><em>The Sxip Network Rootsite:</em> The central identity registry that manages Homesite and Membersite membership in the Sxip Network and issues and stores the data that identifies users as members of the Sxip Network (for example, a user’s Globally Unique Persona Identifiers (GUPIs) are stored at the Sxip Rootsite).</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.sxip.net/"">Link</a>. <a href=""https://www.sxip.net/how_sxip_works"">More detail Link</a>.</p>, <p>This is a decentralized, secure solution that can scale. If websites adopt it, the network effect will kick in massively and this will better the internet.</p>, <p>In their own words, <em>“The Sxip Network is a simple, secure, and open digital identity network. By joining, Internet users are able to create, share and protect the privacy of their online personal information. Websites and portals can establish deeper relationships with their users and comply with privacy legislation, while facilitating single sign-on and easy data release for their users. Sxip believes the Network has the potential to be a key platform for Identity 2.0 infrastructure and weâ€™re working with the community on continuously improving the technology.”</em> <a href=""http://www.sxip.com/sxip_network"">Link</a></p>, <p>This can help the internet in non-obvious ways, like killing comment and trackback spam. Sxip demoed at Supernova an Alpha release of Sxore, their free new comment server that stops comment spam on blogs (Sxore uses Sxip Network technology).  It should be<br/>
available soon and information is available at <a href=""https://sxore.com/blog/"">sxore.com/blog/</a>.</p>, <p>You can try this out (as a user) on a demo site <a href=""https://demohomesite.com/secure/editPreferences.do"">here</a>.</p>, <p><strong>Network Diagram:</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/sxipnetworkdiagram.jpg""/></p>, <p><strong>Management:</strong></p>, <p>Dick Hardt – Founder &amp; CEO<br/>

Odeo is great and works really well. We just have a funny feeling that iTunes 4.9 is going to have a somewhat substantial impact on the podcasting portal market.  One thing to note, though, is that iTunes is only most of the online music market, not all of it. Odeo and others can help fill in the gaps.</em></p>, <p><strong>Company:</strong> <a href=""http://www.odeo.com"">Odeo</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/edeologo.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Previous Profile:</strong> June 13, 2005<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=13""> Link</a></p>, <p><strong>What’s New?</strong></p>, <p>Lots of Odeo beta invites went out today, and TechCrunch received one.

The Odeo Syncr, which let’s you download anything in the catalog (and, optionally, put it on your MP3 player). And creation tools, including the Odeo Studio, which let you publish your own audio content, which will then show up in the catalog. (The creation tools aren’t already for public use yet, though.)”</em></p>, <p><strong>Key additional information:</strong></p>, <p>– 6.3 meg syncr download (allows easy syncing with mp3 players, auto adding, etc.)<br/>

– nice tools for finding/searching for podcast “channels” and adding them to your subscription<br/>

Profile: BuzzNet,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><strong>Company:</strong> <a href=""http://www.buzznet.com"">BuzzNet</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/buzznetlogo.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Founded:</strong> March 2003</p>, <p><strong>Location:</strong></p>, <p>Buzznet, Inc.<br/>
2404 Wilshire Blvd. #11b<br/>
Los Angeles, CA 90057<br/>
(213) 252-8999 phone<br/>
(213) 252-8955 fax</p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>BuzzNet is a photo-sharing community. It’s hard to talk about BuzzNet without comparing and contrasting it to Flickr. It shares most or all of Flickr’s strengths, and has a few additional features as well. It’s these additional features that make it better, in my opinion, both for casual and/or “mobile” users as well as serious photographers looking for a way to share their work. I’ll explain why below.</p>, <p>First, the basics. You can check out a quick tour <a href=""http://www.buzznetinc.com/tour/"">here</a> that shows how it all works.  Sign up for a free BuzzNet account and you can upload photos directly to their website, or email photos with a unique email address that contains a keyword you choose. This allows for easy mobile photoblogging – just snap a picture with your phone and have it up on your photoblog in seconds.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/whatisbuzznet.gif""/></p>, <p>Pictures can be tagged (they call it “buzzwords”) by you and anyone else (Flickr only allows tagging by you and your friends). Users can search/browse by these tags, and they are indexed at Technorati as well and thumbnails are shown for technorati searches for those tags. See, for instance, a <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/tag/seattle"">technorati tag search on “Seattle”</a> and check out the BuzzNet and Flickr photos on the right.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/buzzwords.gif""/></p>, <p>Every user has a unique URL for their pictures, comments and profile information. You can see the Techcrunch photoblog at <a href=""http://techcrunch.buzznet.com/user/"">techcrunch.buzznet.com</a>. For infinitely cooler photoblogs, check out some of the featured ones on the <a href=""http://www.buzznet.com/"">home page</a>. For example, a guy named Adam Richman, who recorded an album in his parents’ basement in Pennsylvania, is photoblogging while on tour. <a href=""http://adamrichman.buzznet.com/user/"">Link</a></p>, <p>Uploading pictures is easy, and here’s the part that I like better than Flickr: Instead of limiting the amount of upload capacity (20 megs per month at Flickr), BuzzNet only limits the number of total photos you can upload per month (just increased from 60 to 120 on the free account). Why is this important? Here’s why – With Flickr I have to take time to resize photos so that I don’t immediately use up my monthly allotment with just ten 2 mb pictures. At BuzzNet, I just send in the big file and they resize for me. And a little known fact (told to me by Marc Brown, the co-founder and President), is that the original, full size image is stored for me by BuzzNet – a killer archive tool for serious photographers and it will allow them to offer high-quality printing services in the future (just click a button and they can create a bound album and send it to you).</p>, <p>BuzzNet seems to have more “buzz” around photos than Flickr as well. Marc tells me that, of those photos with comments, there are an average of five comments, higher than Flickr. Since BuzzNet has deeper profiling of users than Flickr, it seems obvious that more social networking will occur.</p>, <p><strong>Additional Features: </strong></p>, <p>– easy posting<br/>
– unique URL for every user<br/>
– RSS feed for every user page<br/>
– commenting on pictures (with user settings)<br/>
– easy tagging<br/>
– generous free account features – 120 photos per month<br/>
– easy to invite friends to join<br/>
– get three friends to join and they’lll upgrade your account to a premium subscription for a full year<br/>
– Buddy list<br/>
– Trackbacks (who links to you)<br/>
– Bookmarks (your favorite photos on Buzznet)<br/>
– Favorite communities and Buzzwords/tags<br/>
– Private messaging â€“ like web-based email<br/>
– Custom design templates<br/>
– Share Photos: e-mail photo to a friend<br/>

It is currently mostly an information site, with additional features to be launched in the summer 2005. It has different sections for podcasters and for listeners:</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.podshow.com/podcasters.html"">For Podcasters</a>:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/podshowforpodcasters.gif""/></p>, <p>This area of the site gives information on how to produce and promote a show, as well as getting it featured in the Sirius and/or PodShow network. I imagine future releases will have additional tools and features, but for now links include <a href=""http://www.ipodder.org"">iPodder.org</a> and <a href=""http://www.podcastalley.com/"">Podcast Alley</a>.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.podshow.com/listeners-podcastinginfo.html"">For Listeners</a>:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/podshowforlisteners.gif""/></p>, <p>This area of the site gives listeners basic information on podcasts and how to find and listen to shows.  On the home page there is also a nice flash tool to listen to PodShow’s featured shows directly (no downloading from here though):</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/podshowforlisteners2.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>iPodder:</strong></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.ipodder.org/"">iPodder.org</a> is a site that gives good basic information on podcasting and also has a nice podcast directory and tool for downloading podcasts and getting them on portable music players. This is a functional site and I imagine it will become part of the overall PodShow architecture and brand.</p>, <p><strong>Daily Source Code:</strong></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.dailysourcecode.com/"">DailySourceCode.com</a> is Adam Curry’s daily audio blog. Here you can download and/or listen to Adam’s daily thoughts on…everything. For instance, today’s show can be heard <a href=""http://mp3.dailysourcecode.podshow.com/DSC-2005-06-24.mp3"">here</a>. Check it out. It’s awesome and always a fun listen. It’s currently the most popular podcast show with Dave Winer’s <a href=""http://www.morningcoffeenotes.com/"">Morning Coffee Notes</a> a close second. <a href=""http://biz.yahoo.com/special/podcast05.html"">Link</a></p>, <p><strong>Sirius Radio Show</strong>:</p>, <p>Adam also has a weekday radio show on <a href=""http://sirius.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Sirius/Page&amp;c=FlexContent&amp;cid=1115038974898&amp;flash=flash"">Sirius Radio</a>. <em>“Adam Curryâ€™s PodShow can be heard weekdays from 6 pm to 10 pm ET on SIRIUS Talk Central // Ch. 148. The four-hour, weekday show covers every aspect of the podcasting revolution â€” from talk to comedy to music â€” and introduce listeners to undiscovered artists from around the world…Along with podcastingâ€™s best talk, comedy and music, Adam Curryâ€™s PodShow lets listeners provide feedback, helping to shape the showâ€™s format on an ongoing basis.”</em></p>, <p><strong>How will all of this come together?</strong></p>, <p>We have no idea, but we look forward to future releases! <em>“<a href=""http://www.podshow.com/aboutus.html"">Stay tuned for more updates and features as we ramp up for our launch this summer.</a>“</em> Yup, we definitely will.</p>, <p>There are major differences between this group of companies and the other podcast directories and services (see, for instance, <a href=""http://www.odeo.com/account/betalogin"">Odeo</a> – our profiles <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/index.php?s=odeo"">here</a>). The primary difference is that Podshow owns the most popular podcast in the world, and is run by a celebrity (and nice guy) – Adam Curry. So, do they have a chance against (or to work with) the upcoming iTunes 4.9? Yes, of course – and by the way, Adam Curry was featured in Apple CEO Steve Jobs keynote address at the WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference) from San Franciscoâ€™s Moscone West on June 9. <a href=""http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/wwdc05/"">Link to Video</a></p>, <p>I wonder if we’ll hear anything new at Adam’s <a href=""http://www.gnomedex.com/schedule.phtml"">Gnomedex keynote </a>tomorrow afternoon? :-)<br/>

Naneu Pro Military-Ops Sierra Review,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"" border=""0"" class=""center"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/mo-s-popup1.jpg""/>While “carrying an SLR and laptop” aren’t usually considered military ops, at least according to the marine I know (Hi Chris!), the Naneu Pro Sierra bag is quite an original. Designed to hold both a camera and a laptop, the bag is compact and well-proportioned, allowing a 12-inch Powerbook and my Rebel XT to cohabitate like college virgins discovering the first taste forbidden love.</p>, <p>I tried this on a few flights and discovered that as a standard SLR and laptop case, the Sierra is perfect. Inserts keep things safe on the SLR side and there’s just enough room to slide in the laptop without fear of damage. Unfortunately, when I took out the padded inserts and tried to use it as a carry-on for books and magazines, I discovered some limitations.<br/>
<span id=""more-49""></span><br/>
The Sierra is chock-full of pockets and many of them couldn’t quite hold a larger magazine – Marie Claire was HUGE last month – without having things hang out over the edge. A few books also overwhelmed the laptop pocket. However, if you need a bag that does what it advertises – safely totes your camera and laptop sans interaction – this is a winner.</p>, <p>Who is this for? The camera geek on the go, plain and simple. Although the Lima does include a compass on one of the straps, your best bet is to avoid shock and awe tactics and instead focus on carrying your camera and smaller laptop safely through the Tampa airport. $89.99 on Naneu’s homepage.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.naneupro.com/products.mdv?p=mo-s"">Product Page</a> [Naneu]</p>]"

The site isn’t very deep and appears to focus on less-than-fully-dressed women, so it isn’t exactly an imdb.com replacement. However, it has a single interesting feature that makes it web 2.0 relevant – anonymous tagging by users.</p>, <p>When you view a particular picture, tags that users have added appear next to the picture, along with an “Add Tag!” button:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/celebrityflickertags.gif""/></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/celebrityflicker2.gif""/></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.celebrityflicker.com/index.php/photo/1594"">Link</a></p>, <p>This is meaningful because it is one of the first experiments in anonymous user tagging of content on a site in order to relate one piece of content to other pieces. In the above screen shots, the user-generated tags next to the Trainspotting picture are:</p>, <p>    * heroin<br/>
    * life<br/>
    * choose<br/>
    * actress<br/>
    * macdonald<br/>
    * kelly<br/>
    * trainspotting</p>, <p>Each of these tags link to other pictures that have been tagged identically by other users. This means that the site is using its users to make its content more easily findable. For instance, if you click on the “trainspotting” link, you get this page:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/celebrityflicker3.gif""/></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.celebrityflicker.com/index.php?section=photo&amp;action=tags&amp;tag=trainspotting"">Link</a></p>, <p>Most results aren’t as relevant as this one though. A big issue with user tagging is generating real v. useless results. We’ll write more on this later in a post we are writing about the recently released Feedster anonymous tagging feature.</p>, <p>With Delicious, users have a real incentive to tag properly – so that they can find the content again later via searching or browsing of their tags. With celebrity flicker that incentive is significantly less powerful and so the results are significantly less significant.<br/>
<strong><br/>
What does this prove?</strong></p>, <p>It means that if a web 2.0 service is going to add user tagging, especially <em>anonymous</em> user tagging, they better provide one heck of a good incentive for users to do it (see Delicious, Furl, etc.) or else they will get bad data.</p>, <p><strong>What about publisher tagging?</strong></p>, <p>Publisher tagging is a different animal. As an example of publisher tagging, see the tags we’ve added to this post at the very end. This helps real-time search engines like technorati, pubub, feedster and others quickly index posts in a contextual way and relate it to similar content (which publishers want and so they have an incentive to do it and do it properly). Further, the links below allow readers of this post to click (in our case to technorati) to see similarly tagged content if they are interested in the subject.</p>, <p>There is also an incentive by publishers to “spam”, however, which is a problem with publisher tagging.</p>, <p><strong>Links:</strong></p>, <p><a href=""http://corp.feedster.com/blog/rafer/archives/2005/05/anonymous_taggi_1.html"">Scott Rafer</a><br/>

Profile: iTunes 4.9,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><strong>Service:</strong> <a href=""http://www.apple.com/itunes/"">iTunes 4.9 with Podcasts</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/ituneslogo.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Launched: </strong>June 28, 2005<br/>
<strong><br/>
What is it?</strong></p>, <p>As was widely anticipated, iTunes 4.9 launched today (22 mb download) for both windows and mac platforms. It includes significant new and enhanced features, including, most notably, support for podcasts.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/itunes0628051.gif""/></p>, <p>Michael Gartenberg <a href=""http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/gartenberg/archives/008993.html"">writes a wonderful post</a> on iTunes 4.9: <em>“I can download one, subscribe to a feed, keep a set number on my device and have them automatically deleted after I’ve listened. In short Apple’s done for podcasting the same thing they did with RSS in Tiger. They made it usable by the mass markets and at the same time, they have the what is going to be the most widely used podcasting client on both Macintosh and Windows and that will make their directory the one to be listed in. But there’s more. Apple also tweaked the firmware in all the iPod so there’s no a separate podcasting category, which means podcasts won’t get shuffled with my music and will support bookmarks so I can listen to podcasts and resume where I left off. So it’s not just the premier podcast PC client, the iPod itself is now first among devices with integrated podcast support. Combine this news and the new pricing and the integration of iPod photo into the core white iPod line and you see why Apple remains the player to beat in this space.”</em></p>, <p>The software is excellent and includes <strong>notable features:</strong></p>, <p>– all podcasts are currently free<br/>
– downloaded podcasts show up in a single iTunes folder called “podcasts”<br/>
– easy search/find<br/>
– one click subscription to a new podcast<br/>
– option to have all future podcasts download automatically<br/>
– Tools for submitting publisher podcasts on iTunes<br/>
– stays separate in iPod, so not shuffled with music<br/>
– autodelete after listening (awesome!)</p>, <p><strong>Screen shots:</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/itunes0628052.gif""/></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/itunes0628053.gif""/></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/itunes0628054.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Links:</strong></p>, <p><a href=""http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/06/goodbye_ipodder.html"">Fred Wilson</a><br/>

Profile: Rainy Daze,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><em><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> This is about Rainy Daze, but it’s also about the evolution of web 1.0 to web 2.0 and Rainy Daze is a useful conduit for this discussion.</em></p>, <p><strong>Company:</strong> <a href=""http://www.rainydaze.com/"">Rainy Daze</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/ranydazelogo.gif""/><br/>
<strong><br/>
Why is Rainy Daze being Profiled on Techcrunch?</strong></p>, <p>Rainy Daze is NOT web 2.0. It screams web 1.0.</p>, <p>But there is a reason why its here. I read an article today (referred from <a href=""http://www.whatsweb20.com/"">What’s Web 2.0?</a>) that was written by Troy Angrinon called “Shifting paradigms: The mental evolutionary process of moving from web 1.0 to web 2.0 in 17 steps” (<a href=""http://www.troyangrignon.com/blog/_archives/2005/6/19/955532.html"">Link</a>) (and who, I note, writes with <a href=""http://www.qumana.com/"">Qumana</a> (<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=18"">profile</a>).</p>, <p>The article was originally an email to a friend, and Troy decided to post it to his blog. TechCrunch exists, partially, for similar reasons. We were being asked by friends about web 2.0 and the companies and products that define it, constantly, and so we decided to blog about them instead. Blogging about interesting stuff is just so much easier than having lots and lots of one-on-one conversations.</p>, <p>Troy’s article reminded me of a post from last year by <a href=""http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/02/blogging_10.html"">Fred Wilson called Blogging 1.0</a>.  It is a must read for any friends that ask you why blogging is different from geocities. I wrote about the article in my personal blog, adding a few things that I thought were important (how blogging is possible because of better software (Troy talks about this) and how they leverage the network effect).</p>, <p>So why Rainy Daze? Last week Keith Teare and I were at Gnomedex, and staying up in town called Anacortes on an island north of Seattle. One evening at dinner we met a local couple (Keri and Jonathan) who were very nice and listened to us discuss the significance of that day’s <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=42"">Microsoft announcement of their support for RSS</a> and how it was important, <em>really</em> important, to the evolution of the web. They were interested (really!?) and seemed to wanted to understand how all the new technology would affect them. And then they told us about Rainy Daze, a website they run from their home and where they sell hand made soaps and other bath stuff.</p>, <p>I believe that someday soon, sites like Rainy Daze will incorporate web 2.0 features, probably from companies we’ve profiled or will profile here at Techcrunch.</p>, <p>I also believe that it’s important to think about sites like these, because ultimately the stuff we are doing today will affect people’s lives.</p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>Rainy Daze has very cool stuff. In their own words, <em>“Rainy Daze began with the idea of creating and enhancing all-natural skin care products with the wonderful scent of essential oils. Our products are a welcome change from commercially manufactured products because they are handcrafted using ingredients you can recognize, such as silk. Adding silk creates a soap rich in moisture, leaving your skin feeling soft and smooth. We also add moisturizing oils such as jojoba, sweet almond, avocado, hemp seed and shea and cocoa butters creating an incredible hydrating effect. In keeping with our natural approach, we avoid unnecessary colors and additives. We choose only the finest ingredients and pride ourselves on providing you with a top-notch quality product.</em></p>, <p>In 1999 we began making soap as gifts for friends and family. Because of the requests for replacements, we envisioned an opportunity for growth and fine-tuned our process in order to turn our hobby into a business. Soap making is the creative outlet that has brought inspiration into our lives and given us the opportunity to work with our hands. We are excited about our product line and absolutely love what we do!”</p>]"
Profile: Yahoo My Web 2.0,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><strong>Service: </strong><a href=""http://myweb2.search.yahoo.com/"">Yahoo My Web 2.0</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/yahoomyweblogo.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Launched:</strong> June 29, 2005</p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>MyWeb2.0 is a social search engine <em>“that complements web search by enabling users to search the knowledge and expertise of their friends and community in addition to the web.”</em> We’ve used and abused it for a day, and in our opinion it’s good – a bit like regular yahoo plus furl (<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=30"">profile</a>).</p>, <p>It was launched today as an early beta version “for a limited number of users.” There could be a cutoff, so it’s a good idea to sign up soon if you want an early look (what a great marketing idea).</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/yahoomyweb0629051.gif""/></p>, <p>Once you sign up (you can use an existing yahoo account), you can do a number of things. If you want to bookmark web pages, we recommend downloading the yahoo toolbar, which will allow you to bookmark pages you are browsing. Otherwise, you can only bookmark pages found on normal Yahoo search.  We don’t like toolbars very much because nearly half our screen is taken up with them, but if you want to use MyWeb2.0 it’s going to have to be a part of your life (and hey, maybe you already use the Yahoo toolbar).</p>, <p>When you bookmark a page a popup appears that allows you to enter meta-data on the site, including title, notes, tags, access controls and a “save page” option (again, all of this looks and feels very much like furl:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/yahoomyweb0629052.gif""/></p>, <p>You can also invite friends (feel free to add us – archimedesventures@yahoo.com) (techcrunch was taken :-)), and see their bookmarked pages. The whole idea is that stuff that is relevant to your friends, could very well be relevant to you, too.</p>, <p>This is user tagging in action (see our profiles on <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=51"">Celebrity Flicker</a> and <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=54"">Feedster</a> for a discussion of the perils of this), but here you have real incentives (like delicious and furl) to do it properly – both to find stuff later and to share with your friends.</p>, <p>Yes, it is yet another service to add friends and go to the trouble of bookmarking sites, but it does have in inport option (including RSS feeds) (yeah!)  to decrease the burden. I imported my personal delicious page RSS feed and it seemed to work reasonably well.</p>, <p>There’s a ton thats been written about this (see links below), so our recommendation is try read the reviews and try it out for yourself. Thanks, Yahoo, for launching this experiment in Web 2.0.<br/>

In their own words, <em>“A whole new crop of venture-funded startups focused on vertical search are beginning to enter the field and draw attention. Search is going Vertical — vertical search engines are available for local businesses, product &amp; shopping search, travel search, weblog &amp; news search, and search for classified &amp; jobs listings, with more domain-specific search engines debuting every month.”</em></p>, <p>The event focused on search, obviously, and web 2.0 themes were prevalent throughout. The event was very well blogged and we’ve linked to many of the posts below.</p>, <p>All of the segments were interesting and well organized. A key focus was on investments in this space, of course, and the technology and customer approaches needed to dominate in niche search areas.</p>, <p>The most interesting segment from our perspective was on news/blog search. The panel was moderated by Om Malik (with Steve Gillmor stepping in at the beginning because Om was late). In our opinion the seating of the panelists was symbolic when thinking about their companies from a web 2.0 perspective.</p>, <p>Left to right, you had Chris Tolles (Topix.net), Jim Pitkow (moreover), Scott Rafer (feedster), Tantek Celik (technorati), and Om Malik. From the discussion it was very clear who “got” web 2.0 and who didn’t. As you went from left to right, the panelists were more focused on web 2.0, peaking with Om (I overheard a comment after the panel from an audience member that said “they spent more time on Om’s blog than on all of the others’ sites combined”). :-)</p>, <p>Om kept asking questions that the others just couldn’t answer about user interfaces, search relevance and tagging. Chris, at the web 1.0 end of the table, wasn’t keen on RSS and tagging, and stated repeatedly that Topix.net went for the “wow” factor in deciding where to place content. “People want to hear about murders and bankruptcies, not companies making their numbers”, said Chris when asked about search relevance. Scott and Tantik just shook their heads, as did most of the audience.  Om looked away towards the audience and chuckled.</p>, <p>That being said, topix.net is an awesome site and after sifting through their 250 RSS feeds I found a great one and subscribed.</p>, <p>There is a fundamental shift going on in the Internet, and some people speak the new language. Others simply hear gibberish.</p>, <p>Overall, a wonderful conference, terrific networking event, and plenty of coffee was available all day.

Profile: Gizmo,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><strong>Company:</strong> <a href=""http://www.gizmoproject.com/"">Gizmo</a></p>, <p>&lt;img src='http://tctechcrunch.files.wordpress.com/gizmologo.gif' alt='' border=1 /</p>, <p><strong></strong>Launched: June 30, 2005</p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>Gizmo is like skype but is built on open source. It’s available for Mac and Windows (3.1 mb download on windows), with a Linux version promised in August.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/gizmohome.gif""/></p>, <p>A problem with Skype is that it is a closed silo – it will not interconnect with other VOIP systems. Gizmo, however, is built on the open source, standards-based net calling program built by <a href=""http://www.sipphone.com"">SIPphone</a>. According to Gizmo, there are over 100 applications peering with SIPphone technology (<a href=""http://www.gizmoproject.com/about-gizmo.html"">link</a>).</p>, <p>Gizmo has nearly every feature that Skype has, plus a few really cool things Skype doesn’t do. It does lack instant messaging, however. Once it has that, it will be superior to what Skype offers today, and at a much lower price. Here is a feature-by-feature comparison:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/skypevgizmo.gif""/><br/>
<a href=""http://www.michaelrobertson.com/archive.php?minute_id=177"">Link</a></p>, <p>We tested a call earlier today and the quality was on par or better than Skype. The user interface is slick and very much what people are used to seeing with Skype and IM clients:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/gizmoclient1.gif""/></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/gizmoclient2.gif""/></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/gizmoclient3.gif""/></p>, <p>There is no set limit to the number of callers, but they recommend only 4 (or more if people are on mute): <em>“Technically, there is no limit to the number of people that can conference call together on the Gizmo Project system. We have found that as a practical limit, the sound quality degrades once you have more than 4 people. You can get around this limitation by having people put thier Gizmo Project’s on mute while they’re not talking. Using this system of putting everyone on mute, we have had successfull conference calls with as many as 28 people in 11 countries.”</em> <a href=""http://support.gizmoproject.com/?_a=knowledgebase&amp;_j=questiondetails&amp;_i=51"">Link</a></p>, <p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>, <p>– open source<br/>
– works on SIP standard<br/>
– works with any WiFi SIP phone<br/>
– free voicemail<br/>
– call record (awesome)<br/>
– Call in from POTS<br/>
– Call out to POTS<br/>
– map call location</p>, <p>The “map call” feature is really cool.

Profile: DinnerBuzz,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><strong>Company:</strong> <a href=""http://www.dinnerbuzz.com"">Dinnerbuzz</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/dinnerbuzzlogo.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Launched:</strong> June 2005</p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>Dinnerbuzz is a new service that allows users to provide feedback on restaurants, bars and coffee shops. It leverages user-provided metadata (including tagging) to allow others to easily find and read content on restaurants.</p>, <p>In their own words, <em>“Dinnerbuzz is designed to make it easier for you to find a place for dinner (and drinks) (or coffee). It’s a social guide to restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. When you post, your tags are shared with everyone. Tags make it easy to find places you might not have known about before. And since Dinnerbuzz enables you to filter tags locally, finding interesting places (and people) has never been quicker!”</em> <a href=""http://www.dinnerbuzz.com/about.php"">Link</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/dinnerbuzz1.gif""/></p>, <p>So, what we have with Dinnerbuzz is a new social networking site that leverages user tagging.</p>, <p><em>tangent begins…</em></p>, <p>We note two emerging trends in the web 2.0 space.</p>, <p>The first trend is the huge proliferation of new social networks/tagging services and the difficulty as a user in keeping up.  The second trend is the “problem” with user tagging.</p>, <p>With regard to the first trend, we’ve all been thinking about it, and John Battelle pointed it out in a recent <a href=""http://battellemedia.com/archives/001668.php"">post</a> (discussed here previously) – <em>“it’s a pain in the ass to keep creating social networks, maintaining groups, tagging, sharing, etc. It’s a habit I’m not sure the masses will ever get into, at least in a way that is driven by pure selflessness.”</em></p>, <p>The second trend is the “problem” with user tagging. People need an incentive or they just won’t do it (see our profiles on <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=51"">CelebrityFlicker</a> and <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?cat=42"">feedster</a> – <em>“if a web 2.0 service is going to add user tagging, especially anonymous user tagging, they better provide one heck of a good incentive for users to do it (see Delicious, Furl, etc.) or else they will get bad data.”</em>)</p>, <p>These will sort themselves out over time, with winners and losers, but new companies thinking of adding these features, or basing themselves on them, need to think forward or risk being a loser.</p>, <p>Back to Dinnerbuzz: Is there an incentive for user tagging? We’ll wait and see.</p>, <p><em>…tangent ends</em></p>, <p><strong>Reader Experience: </strong></p>, <p>Anyone can search Dinnerbuzz for restaurants and read reviews. There are a number of great search options. Every city has a set page, and from there searches can be done by tag (like “mexican”) and/or rating (up to 10). Once a sufficient number of restaurants have been rated in a city, it could be a very useful way of searching for a good new restaurant.</p>, <p>RSS feeds are available for everything, from monitoring a single city, restaurant or user’s reviews, to reading new reviews as they come in. For instance, you can see our profile and reviews <a href=""http://www.dinnerbuzz.com/user.php?techcrunch"">here</a> (we really, really like <a href=""http://www.dinnerbuzz.com/place.php?145"">El Tarasco</a> in Manhattan Beach – I’m trying to figure out an angle where I can call it “web 2.0” and profile it here :-)) and there is a big fat XML button right there in the middle of the page. This is all very well done.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/dinnerbuzzuserprofile.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Publisher Experience:</strong></p>, <p>Once you’ve registered (simple, no captcha or email verification), you can post your own reviews. The first step is typing in the restaurant name and location. Dinnerbuzz uses the yahoo mapping <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.net/search/local/V1/localSearch.html"">api</a> for local search.</p>, <p>Submitting a restaurant consists of entering its name and location, adding tags and comments (free text) and rating it from 1-10:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/dinnerbuzzsubmit.gif""/></p>, <p>If Dinnerbuzz can’t find a perfect match for your restaurant it suggests a few close matches. If there are no close matches, there is an option to add a location.</p>, <p>Overall, adding and reviewing a restaurant is a good experience for US locations, but there are two problems (one easily fixed). First, the options include all yahoo local search options, so you see real estate brokers, plumbers, dentists, etc. for close matches (no idea if this is “fixable” within the Yahoo api constraints). Second, if there are close matches, there is no “add” button if one of the matches isn’t correct (easy to add this).</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/dinnerbuzzsubmit2.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>, <p>– great integration with Yahoo Local data<br/>
– search by tag, rating or tag+ rating<br/>
– every city has a city page, users can then sort by tag and/or rating<br/>
– easy submit of new location<br/>
– publishers can add new location if no match with Yahoo Local<br/>
– RSS everywhere (yeah!)</p>, <p><strong>Needed Fixes/Features:</strong></p>, <p>– ability to add or delete entries<br/>
– expand “add” functionality when there are close matches (not just no match)<br/>
– add friends and see/subscribe to their reviews<br/>
– fix non-restaurant data in close matches</p>, <p>Dinnerbuzz is a cool experiment and most of its obvious flaws are easily fixed (and they are adding features) If they can tie it in with other social networking services it could become a very useful service over time.</p>, <p><strong>Links:</strong></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.dinnerbuzz.com"">Site</a><br/>

<strong><br/>
Previous Profile:</strong> <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=15"">June 14, 2005</a></p>, <p><strong>What’s New?</strong></p>, <p>Feedburner had a “Hackathon” (see <a href=""http://bnoopy.typepad.com/bnoopy/2005/05/keeping_innovat.html"">Joe Kraus on hackathons</a>) day last Thursday, where engineers dropped their projects for a day and worked on new features that could be designed, implemented and tested in a single day.</p>, <p>They came up with seven new features (<a href=""http://www.burningdoor.com/feedburner/archives/001299.html"">link</a>):</p>, <p>– <strong>Ping Server </strong>– alert FeedBurner that your blog has been updated and would like FeedBurner to update your FeedBurner feed now, instead of waiting for the normal 30 minute auto-renew.<br/>
– <strong>Geotag Your Feed</strong> – add geographic position to your FeedBurner feed.<br/>
– <strong>Title/description Burner </strong>– allows you to change the title and/or description of your feed without changing anything in your source feed or in your blogging tool.<br/>
– <strong>FeedMedic</strong> – notify you of any errors FeedBurner encounters when regularly processing your source feed.<br/>
– <strong>Javascript Circulation Ticker </strong>– with Awareness API enabled, allows you to get a daily ticker to place on your blog, displaying whether your circulation is going up or down.<br/>
– <strong>ImageCast </strong>– enhancement to SmartCast service beyond audio and video enclosures.<br/>
– <strong>StatsTracker Dashboard Widget (Mac only)</strong> – view your feedâ€™s circulation with the new StatsTracker widget for Mac OS X Dashboard.</p>, <p>Our favorites are the new ping server (the weblogs.com ping server will be profiled here soon) for fast updates, and the circulation ticker (neat tool to put on your blog). I’m trying to dig up a mac while Keith is on vacation to try out the statstracker widget.</p>, <p><strong>Links:</strong></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.burningdoor.com/feedburner/archives/001299.html"">Blog</a><br/>

Profile: TagCloud,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><strong>Service: </strong><a href=""http://www.tagcloud.com"">TagCloud</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/tagcloudlogo.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Launched:</strong> June 2005</p>, <p><strong>Location:</strong> Bellwood, PA</p>, <p><strong>Status:</strong> Corporate name is <a href=""http://www.ionzoft.com/main/index.php"">IonZoft</a></p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>TagCloud is a service that generates a “tagcloud” (see below) based on provided URLs or feeds. A tagcloud is basically a grouping of tags associated with content, from a single or multiple sources. Tagclouds are a visual tool – tags used more often are bigger and/or darker than less used tags, allowing a visual representation of relative tag use. Clicking on a tag takes the user to relevant content related to the tag – basically a list of content associated with such tag (ranking is usually by date, or freshness, but this is not a requirement.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/tagcloudhome.gif""/></p>, <p>TagCloud is a tool for creating tagclouds. A key fact to point out right at the start is that TagCloud uses keyword (text) analysis, not tag/category analysis, in creating the tag cloud. This is a point of contention (or at least discussion) around the service and worth noting as you read on.</p>, <p>Here’s a visual example of a tagcloud (remember that in a real tag cloud each item is clickable and links to relevant content):</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/tagcloudexample.gif""/></p>, <p>The reason tagclouds are useful, instead of merely visually entertaining, is that they show in a very clear way the most popular tags and link directly to associated content. <u>This will become increasingly important as the RSS aggregation and search applications collide in the near future </u> (underlined because I am going to point back to this post in 2 years and say “I told you so”).</p>, <p>If you are mathematically inclined, I highly recommend reading Pietro Speroni’s three articles on tagclouds linked to below (see Links). There really is something to this other than a neat visual trick.</p>, <p>TagClouds is an easy to use service, and other than the contentious issue of using text/keyword analysis instead of category/tag analysis, the only problem is that they are extremely slow to generate. Since a key feature is adding these to your blog, the load time can be prohibitively long. An easy fix would be for Tagcloud to cache content periodically and present that cached (and slightly dated) content instead of re-generating the tag cloud on every html or xml call – I assume they are considering this. The speed issue is a killer and I would much prefer slightly old data instead of waiting 2-3 minutes for my blog to fully load in a browser.</p>, <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>, <p>– easy sign up<br/>
– easy to create a cloud based on a single feed or url<br/>
– easy to create a cloud based on a group of feeds<br/>
– import an opml file for easy creation of a massive cloud<br/>
– good <a href=""http://www.tagcloud.com/User/Implement.php"">tools</a> for publishing clouds on websites<br/>
– dedicated URLs for each cloud, in html and xml format<br/>
– show any number of tags in the cloud, up to 250</p>, <p>As Pietro writes, a tag set or tagcloud for a single source of information is not very interesting. For instance, here is the tagcloud for Techcrunch only:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/tagcloudtechcrunchcloud.gif""/><br/>
<a href=""http://www.tagcloud.com/cloud/html/techcrunch/default/50"">Link</a> (long load time)</p>, <p>Compare this to the tagcloud for our entire opml file, with over 200 feeds of awesome blogs and other content (see list <a href=""http://www.bloglines.com/public/michaelarrington"">here</a>):</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/tagcloudopml1.gif""/><br/>
<a href=""http://www.tagcloud.com/cloud/html/techcrunchfeeds/default/250"">Link</a> (long load time)</p>, <p>It is a much more interesting result set. Remember, clicking on any tag gives a result set. Here is part of the result set after clicking on the “search” tag above:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/tagcloudopml2.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Technology:</strong></p>, <p>Tagcloud uses Yahoo’s <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.net/content/V1/termExtraction.html"">Content Analysis web service<br/>
</a> and simple php to put the feed information into a database, analyze it with the Yahoo tool and generate the cloud:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/tagcloudhow.gif""/><br/>
<a href=""http://www.tagcloud.com/About.php"">Link</a></p>, <p>Given their openness to creation of new applications using tagcloud, this can be an exciting and very useful service over time.</p>, <p>Hint: If aggregators generated a tag cloud for all of my unread content every day, it would be much easier for me to peruse posts that I am interested in. This can solve the overload problem we are all facing as we try to track more and more feeds daily (reading over 200 daily feeds takes me at least 2-3 hours per day right now). What I would like to see is a tag cloud based on tags <u>and</u> keywords.</p>, <p><strong>Creator:</strong></p>, <p>John Herren (his original experiment <a href=""http://yahoo.theherrens.com/"">here</a>)<br/>

Think of it as instant messaging with sound. And lots of people are using Skype – they have well over 100 million downloads of their client and over 1 million paying users.</p>, <p>The network effect has kicked in big time for Skype.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/skype1.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Skype has great core features:</strong></p>, <p>– free p2p calling via a “soft phone” (software on your computer instead of a telephone), with up to 4 people at a time<br/>
– basic text IM capabilities<br/>
– file uploading<br/>
– Skype-Out (call any phone number, for a small per minute charge)<br/>
– Skype-In (assign your skype account a phone number, allowing any phone to call you on your computer)<br/>
– voicemail</p>, <p>There are at least two features that would make it much more compelling – <u>application sharing</u> (meaning you can share powerpoint demonstrations, websites, or whatever with people on your call) (see our profile on <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=17"">vskype</a>, which has this as well as video), and <u>call record</u> (see our profile on <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=59"">Gizmo</a>, which has this feature as well as others like mapping).</p>, <p>But in general Skype is fun, cheap and has decent sound quality.<br/>
<strong><br/>
What’s the New Outlook Toolbar?</strong></p>, <p>The new Outlook Toolbar integrates Skype very tightly with Outlook. There is an extremely detailed profile of the product by Peter Henning at <a href=""http://www.skypejournal.com/blog/archives/2005/07/skype_toolbar_f_1.php"">SkypeJournal</a> as well that I recommend reading if you intend to use the product.</p>, <p>It’s a very small download (767k for PC) and installs quickly. In a nutshell, it allows you to:</p>, <p>– Use Skype directly from Outlook (the skype client must be running as well)<br/>
– associate your Outlook contacts with their skype usernames. You can then Skype them directly from Outlook if they are online. If you get an email from them, you’ll see a skype status  icon next to their name, and you can chat or talk with them by clicking. Overall, its a nice integration between two of the most important applications on most PC user’s desktops.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/skype2.gif""/></p>, <p>Another great feature, which you can see in the image above, is that it enables one-click skype-out calls to the contact’s phone numbers. This “<u>click to call</u>” feature is a killer feature. These phone numbers do not need to be separately added to your Skype-Out call list.</p>, <p>Overall, this is a great productivity tool for heavy Skype and Outlook users.</p>, <p><strong>Creators:</strong></p>, <p>Peter Kalmstrom<br/>

Profile – Google Earth (relaunch),"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><strong>Service:</strong> <a href=""http://earth.google.com/"">Google Earth</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/googleearthlogo.gif""/><br/>
<strong><br/>
Previous Profile:</strong> <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=63"">July 2, 2005</a></p>, <p><strong>Launch Date:</strong> Just re-launched</p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>Google Earth combines satellite imagery, aerial photos, maps and Google Search create an interesting application that allows you to view just about anywhere on the planet in at least some level of detail. It is only available on the PC platform for now.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/googleearth1.gif""/></p>, <p>In their own words, <em>“The idea is simple. Itâ€™s a globe that sits inside your PC. You point and zoom to anyplace on the planet that you want to explore. Satellite images and local facts zoom into view. Tap into Google search to show local points of interest and facts. Zoom to a specific address to check out an apartment or hotel. View driving directions and even fly along your route. We invite you to try it now.”</em> <a href=""http://earth.google.com/earth.html"">Link</a></p>, <p><em>“Google Earth puts a planet’s worth of imagery and other geographic information right on your desktop. View exotic locales like Maui and Paris as well as points of interest such as local restaurants, hospitals, schools, and more.”</em> <a href=""http://earth.google.com/"">Link</a></p>, <p>The idea is simple. The technology combines Keyhole (an <a href=""http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/keyhole.html"">acquisition</a>) with other Google data and tools. The visual impact is <a href=""http://earth.google.com/coverage/europe_lg.jpg"">stunning</a>.</p>, <p><strong>But what can you do with it?</strong></p>, <p>Well, lots of things. The first thing we did (and probably everyone else does) was to try and find an image of our home. Here’s where I live, in Manhattan Beach, California (its there in the middle on the beach, I swear):</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/googleearthmanbeach.gif""/></p>, <p>They showcase some really beautiful shots of famous places as well (<a href=""http://earth.google.com/sites/"">link</a>). Here’s the Grand Canyon, for instance:</p>, <p><img alt="""" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/googleearthgrandcanyon.jpg""/></p>, <p><strong>Beyond the visual eyecandy, there are some useful productivity tools included as well:</strong></p>, <p>– Fly from space to your neighborhood. Type in an address and zoom right in.<br/>
– Search for schools, parks, restaurants, and hotels. Get driving directions.<br/>
– Tilt and rotate the view to see 3D terrain and buildings.<br/>
– Save and share your searches and favorites. Even add your own annotations.<br/>
<a href=""http://earth.google.com/"">Link</a></p>, <p>The experience of changing from one location to another is fascinating. The application zooms out from your current location and moves along the globe to the new location, and then zooms in. You can move the screen location around with the mouse (just like google maps).</p>, <p><strong>Minimum Configuration:</strong></p>, <p>There is a 10 mb download.</p>, <p>– Operating system: Windows 2000, Windows XP<br/>

Profile – NewsGator Online v. Bloglines,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><em><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> This is a profile of NewsGator’s online product only, not its outlook, feeddemon and other products. There is a natural tendency to view NewsGator Online in comparison to Bloglines, as the products are both very popular and similar in many ways.</em></p>, <p><strong>Company:</strong> <a href=""http://www.newsgator.com"">NewsGator</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/newsgatorlogo2.jpg""/></p>, <p><strong>Founded:</strong> 2003. <a href=""http://www.newsgator.com/news/archive.aspx?post=58"">Acquired Feeddemon</a> in May 2005.</p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>This profile reviews only NewsGator’s <a href=""http://www.newsgator.com/ngs/default.aspx"">online product</a>. NewsGator has a number of other popular products, including an <a href=""http://www.newsgator.com/ngoutlook25.aspx"">Outlook product</a> and the products offered by <a href=""http://www.feeddemon.com/"">Feeddemon</a> (recently acquired by NewsGator).</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/newsgator1.gif""/></p>, <p>We will probably profile NewsGator’s other products soon. They’ve recently <a href=""http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/archive.aspx?post=767"">changed their pricing structure</a>, and based on its complexity (and user feedback), we suspect things may be further simplified over time. Today, Nick Bradbury (Feeddemon founder) <a href=""http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2005/07/rethinking_feed.html"">further changed</a> pricing for his product.</p>, <p>The reason we like the Online edition is that it is not tied to a single computer. You can log in from anywhere. Also, Bloglines is the gold standard of <a href=""http://allrss.com/rssreaderswebbased.html"">web-based RSS readers</a>, and it is natural to compare and contrast the two services (see our Blogines profile <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=37"">here</a>)</p>, <p><strong>Key Features of NewsGator Online:</strong></p>, <p>– easy import of feeds opml file<br/>
– two pane interface – clippings, folders and feeds on the left, content on the right (similar to bloglines)<br/>
– alphabetizes feeds<br/>
– can view all feeds, or just feeds with new content<br/>
– fast updating<br/>
– great “clipping” tool to save content with one click<br/>
– sorting options includ by date, view older/newer first<br/>
– nascent search abilities<br/>
<strong><br/>
NewsGator v. Bloglines:</strong></p>, <p>Bloglines has recently had significant delays in updating feeds – often updating only once a week. That means content comes infrequently and is stale – just the opposite of the core reason for using an RSS reader.  Their site is also down quite often (who’s seen the infamous <a href=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/newsgatorbloglinesplumber.gif"">Bloglines Plumber</a> recently?) They are the <a href=""http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/columns/executive_tech/article.php/3517646"">largest RSS reader</a> (other than Yahoo) (Bloglines accounts for about 30% of Techcrunch subscriptions, NewsGator is a close second), but these problems are leading many users to try out other services.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/newsgatorbloglinesplumber.gif""/></p>, <p>However, even with its shortcoming, we find that NewsGator Online is not as good as Bloglines (but it’s close).</p>, <p>To test NewsGator, we imported our Bloglines feeds and used it exclusively for a few days. Importing was easy, thanks to the Bloglines export feature and the NewsGator import feature. Snafus are noted below.<br/>
<strong><br/>
Things NewsGator does better than Bloglines:</strong></p>, <p>1. Feeds are updated much more frequently on NewsGator (a very, very important feature).</p>, <p>2. While both services have a “clippings” feature, we found NewsGator’s to be much easier to use – one click. Also, the clippings folder is added to the main directory on the left pane, whereas bloglines has an additional tab to click to view clipped items.</p>, <p>3. If you want a PC or Mac based desktop client, you have the ability to <a href=""http://www.newsgator.com/ngs/AD_Sync.aspx"">sync feeds</a> with that client so you don’t read the same content twice (Bloglines doesn’t offer a desktop service).</p>, <p>4. NewsGator was never down during our testing period. Bloglines is down frequently.</p>, <p><strong><br/>
Things Bloglines does better than NewsGator:</strong></p>, <p>1. Both have two pane interfaces, but Bloglines allows scrolling of the left pane whereas NewsGator doesn’t. This means that you can peruse feeds without losing the content in the right pane. This seems like a small issue, but we found it really annoying when using NewsGator.</p>, <p>2. Bloglines has a “mark all read” feature that clears out all unread content. NewsGator doesn’t have this feature, meaning we had to click on each and every one of our 250+ feeds after importing the opml file to clear out old content. This was a one-time issue, but it certainly got us off on the wrong foot with regard to our NewsGator experience.</p>, <p>3. Both services alphabetize feeds. However, Bloglines disregards “the” before the feedname, and we found it difficult to find the feeds we were used to reading by the name we remembered them by.</p>, <p>4.  Bloglines shows the number of subscribers for each feed, and you can view public subscribers. NewsGator doesn’t do this.</p>, <p>5. Bloglines allows you to view public subscriptions of other users (and add them to your own). NewsGator doesn’t have this feature. Bloglines also has a permanent URI for each subscriber’s public feeds. As an example, here are all of <a href=""http://www.bloglines.com/public/michaelarrington"">my personal feeds</a> on Bloglines.</p>, <p>6.  Bloglines has a “keep new” feature for each post that is useful. NewsGator has no equivalent feature.</p>, <p>7. Bloglines has a useful but little known about email feature – you can create an email address and all emails to that address show up as a feed in bloglines. It’s very useful for subscribing to newsletter type emails that you’d rather have in your RSS reader than your email inbox.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/newsgator2.gif""/><br/>
<strong><br/>
Things Both do well:</strong></p>, <p>Both have great user interfaces, options to open content in a new window or the existing window, options for folders to group feeds and good customer service (inquiries about both were answered promptly, within 24 hours even over a weekend).</p>, <p>Neither service has tagging of content, something <a href=""http://www.rojo.com/"">Rojo</a> (<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=26"">Rojo profile</a>) has, and we’d like to see further experiments in this area.</p>, <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>, <p>To be honest, we could be happy with either one. But if forced to choose, we choose Bloglines based on features available today. If the feed updating issue isn’t worked out, however, or if we see that damn bloglines plumber more than once a month, things may change quickly.</p>, <p>NewsGator has a good track record of responding quickly to user feedback, and most of the blogines features mentioned here could easily be added to NewsGator.</p>, <p>Finally, we note that with the ease of opml exports of feeds, there is no real lock-in of users, and a <a href=""http://www.feednation.com/"">newcomer with fresh ideas</a> could easily and quickly gain real market share.<br/>

Profile – Weblogs.com (Ping Server),"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><strong>Service:</strong> <a href=""http://www.weblogs.com"">Weblogs.com</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/weblogscomlogo.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Launched: </strong>1999</p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>Weblogs.com was the first blogging <u>ping service</u> and remains the largest.</p>, <p><strong>What is a ping service?</strong></p>, <p>A ping service is a server that takes “pings” from blogs (and other sources). The purpose of the ping is to notify the ping server that the source has added new content. This is aggregated with other pings and, if the ping server is open, the data becomes available to third parties. The third parties are able to access the URI of the source and the time of the ping.</p>, <p>Ping services are not discussed very often. There’s not much to look at (the action is in the xml data), and to date they haven’t charged for their services. However, <u>ping servers are the backbone of the blogosphere infrastructure</u> and are a crucially important piece of the real-time web.</p>, <p>Here’s why: Ping servers sit between search engines and blogs. Without ping servers, search engines like feedster, technorati and pubsub would not know if and when blogs and other content sources updated. They would regularly have to index these sites to find out if they’ve updated. With over 10,000,000 blogs, re-indexing every hour would be a massive undertaking – every few minutes, impossible. Instead, they re-index only when a source notifies the ping server that it has updated. It is a much more efficient way for the real-time web to keep “real-time” with only a few minute delay between posting and indexing.</p>, <p>There are many ping servers today (see links below for lists), but Weblogs.com was the first and is by far the largest, as it is built into nearly all blogging software.<br/>
<strong><br/>
Weblogs.com:</strong></p>, <p><a href=""http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dave/"">Dave Winer</a> created Weblogs.com in 1999 as a service to index weblogs. <a href=""http://archive.scripting.com/2001/11/01"">He re-launched it as a ping server in November 2001</a> (see also <a href=""http://newhome.weblogs.com/timelineForTransition"">here</a>) as blogs started to grow beyond the point where it was feasible to re-index them regularly.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/weblogscom1.gif""/></p>, <p>Today Weblogs.com is receiving over 1,000,000 pings per day (<a href=""http://archive.scripting.com/2005/06/24"">link</a>).</p>, <p>Weblogs.com has an <a href=""http://archive.scripting.com/2005/06/25#When:6:50:45PM"">open back end</a> and allows anyone to access its data.</p>, <p><strong>Using Weblogs.com:</strong></p>, <p>To ping weblogs.com, a site sends a a simple XML-RPC message to rpc.weblogs.com, port 80, path /RPC2. that includes the feed name (name of blog or other source) and the URL.</p>, <p>To access ping data, third parties can access two versions: <a href=""http://www.weblogs.com/changes.xml"">weblogs.com/changes.xml</a> shows data from the last hour, and <a href=""http://www.weblogs.com/shortChanges.xml"">weblogs.com/shortchanges.xml<br/>
</a> shows data from the last five minutes.</p>, <p>For more complete information, see the Weblog.com XML-RPC Interface post <a href=""http://www.xmlrpc.com/weblogsCom"">here</a>.</p>, <p><strong>Audio.Weblogs.com:</strong></p>, <p>audio.weblogs.com is a podcasting ping service. It is very much like weblogs.com, but it includes additional data as well:</p>, <p>– size of podcast<br/>
– xml feed of podcast<br/>
– number of clicks on link (a ranking or popularity feature)</p>, <p><img src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/weblogscom2.gif""/></p>, <p>Pinging and accessing audio.weblogs.com data is <a href=""http://www.podcatch.com/howToPing"">similar</a> to the normal weblogs.com ping service.</p>, <p><strong>Links:</strong></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.weblogs.com"">weblogs.com</a><br/>

1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_London_transport_explosions"">Terrorist Attack in London</a></strong></p>, <p>I was flying to Europe for a conference, enjoying my first-ever wifi experience on a plane, when the IMs from friends in London started coming in. “There was an exposion in the tube, they think it was a power converter” one friend said. Then, a few minutes later, “Oh my God, there are reports of explosions everywhere – it may be bus bombs.” Soon I had flight attendants and other flyers coming up to me for updates. The pilot sent a flight attendant back to hear what was happening because she couldn’t get news via radio. I was the only news source on the flight, it seemed.</p>, <p>BBC’s website went down from the traffic, and people turned to blogs for the news. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_London_transport_explosions"">Wikipedia</a> was cited as the most up to date source of information. <a href=""http://www.chrisnolan.com/archives/trevino/2005/07/the_bloody_seventh.html"">Others</a> blogged about their experiences.</p>, <p>From a big media v. blog angle, Fred Wilson summed it up perfectly when he said <em>“This is what its all about and why CNN with its 24×7 news channel is hopelessly out of date.”</em> (linking to <a href=""http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2005_07_07.html#010010"">Jeff Jarvis</a>).</p>, <p>Our heart <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=73"">continues to go out</a> to everyone affected. I was in Manhattan on 9/11. It takes a few days for reality to set in.</p>, <p><strong>2.  BlogHerald: <a href=""http://www.blogherald.com/2005/07/03/blogs-credited-for-role-in-promoting-record-internet-growth/"">Blogs credited for role in promoting record Internet growth</a></strong></p>, <p>Blogherald cited the <a href=""http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2005/07/01/july_2005_web_server_survey.html"">Netcraft report</a> , which showed the largest-ever month-over-month growth in June 2005 domain names.  One of the reasons included “The explosive growth of weblogs, a growing number of which are purchasing domains for branding purposes.”</p>, <p><strong>3. <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2005/07/03/rss-spam-cometh/"">Om Malik on the Power of RSS and the emergence of RSS spam</a></strong></p>, <p><em>“RSS is to the written word, what TiVo is to television. RSS, has been a ruthlessly efficient and rather simple way to keep in touch with the breaking developments in areas that interest.”</em></p>, <p>However, <em>“Will RSS spam become as much a part of life as say email spam or spyware?”</em>.</p>, <p>Also See <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/blogspotting/archives/2005/07/trackback_spam.html?campaign_id=rss_blog_blogspotting"">BusinessWeek</a> for an interesting article on the growth of trackback spam.</p>, <p><strong>4. <a href=""http://internetalchemy.org/2005/07/talis-web-20-and-all-that"">Ian Davis – “Web 2.0 is an attitude not a Technology”</a></strong></p>, <p>Ian writes a wonderful essay, furthering the definition of web 2.0: <em>“Here’s my take on it: <strong>Web 2.0 is an attitude not a technology.</strong> It’s about enabling and encouraging participation through open applications and services. By open I mean technically open with appropriate APIs but also, more importantly, socially open, with rights granted to use the content in new and exciting contexts. Of course the web has always been about participation, and would be nothing without it. It’s single greatest achievement, the networked hyperlink, encouraged participation from the start. Somehow, through the late nineties, the web lost contact with its roots and selfish interests took hold. This is why I think the Web 2.0 label is cunning: semantically it links us back to that original web and the ideals it championed, but at the same time it implies regeneration with a new version. Technology has moved on and it’s important that the social face of the web keeps pace.”</em></p>, <p><strong>5.  <a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/002775.php"">Read/Write Web – Technorati is gaining traction, massively<br/>
</a></strong></p>, <p><em>“Technorati is growing at a rapid rate. It’s recently overtaken Bloglines and is blitzing Feedster. “</em></p>, <p><strong>6. Brian Livingston – <a href=""http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/columns/executive_tech/article.php/3517646"">RSS Readers, Narrowing Down Your Choices</a></strong></p>, <p>Overview of top 20 RSS readers:</p>, <p><em>“Although only a small minority of Internet users have ever subscribed to an RSS feed, the number of blogs out there now is reportedly more than 10 million worldwide.</em></p>, <p>RSS adoption is growing rapidly as a result. Because RSS is, well, really simple, everybody and his brother seems to have written an RSS reader (also called an aggregator) and is vying for your attention.”</p>]"

Profile – Planet Web 2.0,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><strong>Service:</strong> <a href=""http://planetweb20.com/"">Planet Web 2.0</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/planetweb20logo.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Launched:</strong> about two weeks ago</p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>Planet Web 2.0 is a website (and more importantly an RSS feed) that aggregates content from web 2.0 publishers around the web. It’s a must add feed for anyone tracking web 2.0. The sources of the content are linked on the sidebar, and include TechCrunch. :-)</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/planetweb201.gif""/></p>, <p>We first discovered the site while reading Richard MacManus’ excellent and much discussed post “<a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/002776.php"">On Bots and Content Creation / Aggregation</a>” last week.</p>, <p>We have lots of thoughts on Richard’s post (and generally, entirely agree with him). Our feeling is Planet Web 2.0, which goes out of its way to attribute content, is going about this inevitable evolution in the right way, and we support them.</p>, <p>The debate on the issue of re-publishing content goes back as far as the web itself. RSS makes it even easier, of course. In fact, the entire purpose of RSS is the republishing of content. The debate centers on whether it should be republished only in RSS readers, or if it can be republished anywhere. In reality, though, what is the difference between an online RSS reader and a website? Not much, particuarly when you think about how bloglines and other readers allow sharing of feeds…</p>, <p><em><strong>Editor’s Note: </strong>To track the “old” debate on RSS and copyright, see <a href=""http://calacanis.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000450025233/"">Jason Calcanis</a>, <a href=""http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/15.html#a9204"">Robert Scoble</a>,  and <a href=""http://www.makeyougohmm.com/20050116/1335/"">Makeyougohmm</a> to start.</em></p>, <p>So here’s TechCrunch’s position: We like Planet Web 2.0 and think what is doing is a responsible way to promote content, while giving proper attribution to those who wrote it.</p>, <p>In forming our position, we noted Ian Davis’s (the creator of Planet Web 2.0) comments on Richard’s post:</p>, <p><em>“I think you’re uncovering some essential quality of content remixing that perhaps hasn’t been appreciated before. Aggregating and remixing content needs to be done with respect. We should respect the original author’s intent and also the time and effort they put into creating the content. Repurposing, passing off, non-attribution – these are all disrespectful ways to treat content and people. Hopefully I’m treating the writers with respect on Planet Web 2.0 (and other similar sites I host). Perhaps a little bit more traffic will flow to them or perhaps it’ll help people discover related writers to those they already know. Either way I appreciate the work that goes into the writing and only wish I could write half as well as those I read.”</em><br/>
<a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/002776.php"">Link</a></p>, <p>As long as this his position, and his actions reflect his position, we’re behind him all the way.</p>, <p>On a related note, <a href=""http://www.nivi.com/blog"">Nivi</a> (another must read blog) created two aggregate feeds recently – the <a href=""http://www.nivi.com/blog/article/introducing-the-vc-channel/"">Venture Capital Channel </a> and the <a href=""http://www.nivi.com/blog/article/introducing-the-entrepreneur-channel/"">Entrepreneur Channel</a>. He does less attribution than Planet Web 2.0, but it’s clear that his motives are pure. We recommend both.<br/>
<strong><br/>
Planet Web 2.0 Creator:</strong></p>, <p><a href=""http://iandavis.com/"">Ian Davis</a></p>, <p><strong>Update:</strong> I spoke with Ian Davis by email and he provided the following insights on his site:</p>, <p><em>“My motivation for setting up PW was to collect together the writings of<br/>
people I respect in this space. I wanted to understand the Web 2.0<br/>
landscape and keep abreast of new developments and applications. I<br/>
already had a small private subscription list but rather than keep keep<br/>
it to myself I decided to publish and aggregate from it. I reasoned that<br/>
if I was interested in this then there were bound to be others equally<br/>
interested. Hopefully people will come across it via people they already<br/>
read and discover other great writers. The site has only been active for<br/>
a couple of weeks – I think I registered it on the 1st July.</em></p>, <p>I’ve had a long-standing interest in open access to data, collaboration<br/>
and the semantic web. I was involved in authoring the RSS 1.0<br/>
specification back in 2000 and at the time I saw this as the first step<br/>
to an open network of data with RSS giving implied permission for reuse.<br/>
Now, with Web 2.0, I think I have an exciting opportunity to apply the<br/>
same principles to a much wider range of content and services. In fact,<br/>
I’ve just started a new role at a British company called Talis leading<br/>
development of the Silkworm project, a platform for enabling Web 2.0<br/>
applications.</p>, <p>I’m having a lot of fun. It feels like I’ve just discovered Mosaic for<br/>
the first time :)”</p>]"

The first wiki was the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Pattern_Repository"">Portland Pattern Repository</a>, created  on March 25, 1995 by Ward Cunningham.</p>, <p>A defining characteristic of wiki technology is the ease with which pages can be created and updated.

NXT Announces New iPod Dock Equipped Systems,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""MX"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.crunchgear.com/wp-content/uploads/teac-mc-dx22i-mini.jpg""/><img alt=""teac cdx"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.crunchgear.com/wp-content/uploads/teac-cd-x10-minii.jpg""/>NXT has announced today the debut of two new ultra-thin hi-fi systems, both sporting an iPod dock. These two new products (CD-X10i and MC-DX22i) utilize the profound SurfaceSound technology that will deliver full sound out of a pair of thin speakers.</p>, <p>The systems have a multi-functional LCD display with backlight and a clock with timer and sleep modes. The speakers and main unit are wall-mountable and the subwoofer is compact, easily hidden from view. Support for CD-MP3/CD-R/RW playback along with an AM/FM tuner with preset memory rounds out the packages. The suggested price for the CD-X10i and MCDX22i are $249 and $299, respectively.</p>]"
Profile – Browster,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><strong>Company:</strong> <a href=""http://www.browster.com"">Browster</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/browsterlogo.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Launch Date: </strong>Beta in February 2005, Version 1.0 launched today, <a href=""http://www.browster.com/pr_071305.htm"">July 13, 2005</a></p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>Browster is a tool, <u> available only for IE</u> (damn, I just lost half of my readers right there) that pre-fetches content from links on a web page, and makes that content available by mousing-over the link. Too see it visually click <a href=""http://www.browster.com/how_it_works.htm"">here</a>.</p>, <p>So we dusted off IE (used only for FTP these days), downloaded 334k of stuff and had at it.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/browster1.gif""/></p>, <p>Browster allows you to browse search results more quickly and with fewer clicks. Browster will also pre-fetch content from non-search sites if you tell it to (there are a couple of easy ways to do this).</p>, <p>There is a nice feature to basically scroll through search results quickly by clicking on an arrow. It’s hard to explain but works very well.</p>, <p>Browster has CPC advertisements on the top of its window. I don’t mind the ads, but the copyright holders of the content they are showing may. I also wish they would have focused on Firefox before IE…Even though IE still has a very large market share, it seems like most of the cutting edge users are on firefox, or macs. Not having support for those browsers is a serious mistake because your most important customers (bloggers, for instance) won’t use it.</p>, <p>Tom Foremski <a href=""http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2005/07/browsteraa_nift_1.php"">wrote about Browster </a>a few hours ago and pointed out a number of very serious flaws (we agree with some, disagree with others). At the end of the day, our only real concerns are those mentioned above (browser support and copyright infringement issues). From a business model perspective, there’s very little that’s viral or sticky about the product. That means ultimately their liquidity event valuation may be based on their technology rather than their network.</p>, <p>It’s a great tool and as soon as they support firefox I’ll use it regularly.</p>, <p><strong>Additional Screen Shots:</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/browster2.gif""/></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/browster3.gif""/></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/browster4.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Management Team:</strong></p>, <p>Scott Milener, CEO and co-Founder<br/>

BuzzBoost’s job is to redisplay your feed content anywhere you can copy and paste a short snippet of HTML code â€” in a Blogger or TypePad page template, on a corporate website, or even in a “signature” block on a message board. BuzzBoost code is just a short line of JavaScript that displays content items and information from a FeedBurner feed according to settings you provide. You get to control how BuzzBoost displays the following elements:</em></p>, <p>    * Feed Title<br/>
    * Item publication date<br/>
    * Individual item headlines, headlines and plain text, or headlines and original HTML<br/>
    * Plain text item excerpt length<br/>
    * Link to download podcast enclosures (if available)</p>, <p>We know that publishers who are familiar with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) would also want to precisely control the styling of whatever BuzzBoost generates. Therefore, BuzzBoost has the right hooks in the generated HTML to make sure you can style each of BuzzBoost’s elements, which we have documented (see the links at the bottom of this post.)”</p>]"

It is somewhat like <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=65"">DinnerBuzz</a>, without the tagging and with more social networking. They don’t discuss in on the site, but they clearly use the<a href=""http://developer.yahoo.net/search/local/V1/localSearch.html""> yahoo mapping api</a> or some other datebase for business search.</p>, <p>In their own words,<em> “Judy’s Book was started in 2004 by Andy Sack and Chris DeVore. When Andy and his wife Alexa moved to Seattle, Alexa’s mom — Judy -â€“ gave them her ‘little green book’, her personal take on the best service providers in Seattle. Andy and Alexa relied on Judy’s book for help and advice as they settled into their new city. When Chris and his wife Emily needed a handyman, Andy passed along a recommendation from Judy’s book and an idea was born: why not create a ‘little green book’ for busy parents everywhere?

Good idea.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/judysbook4.gif""/></p>, <p>Great site. But its another social networking tool to keep updated…and therefore will have some traction issues.

<strong><br/>
1. Technorati is Dead! Long Live Technorati!</strong></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.technorati.com"">Technorati</a> has dominated web 2.0 news this week. Posts come at it from three different but related angles:</p>, <p>– <u>Technorati’s traffic has lately been dominating the competition, and they are getting a lot of press as well </u>. See no. 5 from<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=76""> last week’s wrapup</a>. Richard MacManus again noted Technorati’s ascension in a post this week called “<a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/002779.php"">Technorati for President</a>“, and cited a recent <a href=""http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,68204,00.html"">Wired Magazine</a> article on them that barely mentioned that they have any competition. Richard writes <em>“You’ve got to hand it to Technorati, they sure know how to get media and blog attention. A recent Wired article makes the extraordinary claim that Technorati is “a public utility on a global scale”. With no mention whatsoever of other blog search engines, Wired compares Technorati to Google…”</em></p>, <p>– <u> Jason Calcanis launches his “Off with their Head” campaign against Technorati (and other blog search engines) </u>.

I will switch to permanently this from Bloglines as soon as the updated features are launched.</p>, <p>This is a Firefox extension, so the download is quick and, unlike their IE plugin, most of the work is done at the server level. The product is therefore much more like their “web edition” than “Pluck for IE”.</p>, <p>Importing feeds via OPML was a snap. I was able to quickly organize them into folders and generally get set up.</p>, <p>I spoke with Matthew Bookspan at Pluck about the product yesterday (Pluck was also nice enough to offer for us to be a beta tester a month ago but we failed miserably in following up). See Matt’s blog post on the release of the product <a href=""http://bookspan.easyjournal.com/entry.aspx?eid=2617161"">here</a>.</p>, <p>Matt assures us that those few features that we found lacking are on the bug/feature list to be added soon.<br/>
<strong><br/>
Features:</strong></p>, <p>– Syncronizes feeds automatically accross all Pluck Products<br/>
– easy feed import via OPML<br/>
– works well with tabbed browsing (open feeds in tabs)<br/>
– publish/share folders<br/>
– bolds feeds with new content<br/>
– choices on RSS feed updates<br/>
– seems to run very, very fast<br/>
– easy to save posts/clippings<br/>
– notification of feed updates â€“ a little toast window above the pluck icon in the status bar:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/pluck2.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Upcoming Features:</strong></p>, <p>– show number of subscribers per feed<br/>
– show number of unread items within a feed<br/>
– check all as “read”<br/>
– syncing of read/unread accross Pluck Products (one of the biggest problems in the industry right now)</p>, <p>Additional Screen Shots:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/pluck3.gif""/></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/pluck4.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Management:</strong></p>, <p>Dave Panos – Chief Executive Officer (co-founder)<br/>

Once you have joined, you can post a profile, upload a resume, post and search for jobs, write testimonials and invite other people.</p>, <p>You can join by invitation only. If you would like an invitation, email us (see our about section) and we will be happy to send you one.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/doostang1.gif""/></p>, <p>In their own words, <em>“Doostang is the trusted professional network. The network grows by invitation only which ensures that all contacts that enter the system are trusted by at least one or more members in the network. The value of the network grows with time as the number of contacts increases. The initial goal of Doostang is to fix the quality vs. quantity gap in online recruiting and job searching.</em></p>, <p>Over 50% of recruiting today is done through the personal network of contacts and a large portion of which is done by email communication. Using your personal network is the most effective way to find the right candidate for a position and to find the perfect job. It eliminates the need to either post a job to an irrelevant audience or to search through the multitude of jobs available on the Internet or newspapers that would be of no interest to you. Doostang provides the infrastructure to connect personal networks together and to create a natural quality filter for recruiting and job searching.</p>, <p>Doostang hails from two Farsi words, “doost” which means friend, and “tang” a word used to symbolize the trust between a close group of people. Farsi, one of the world’s oldest languages dating back to 600BC, was spoken from the borders of India in the far east and Russia and China in the north, to southern shores of the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean in the west. The word Doostang fittingly describes our company’s long term goal to be the trusted professional network.”</p>]"

Cool features include full text search of pages (Furl has this as well) and also the ability to find broken links and fix them. We also like the ability to have private, searchable, taggable free text notes on any page. Any bookmark can also be made private. Finally, the ability to add a <a href=""http://www.simpy.com/simpy/FAQ.do#searchExternal"">simpy search box</a> on your blog or other web page (to search your tags) is great.</p>, <p><strong>Core Features:</strong></p>, <p>– Save and Tag pages with a single click using the Simpy Bookmarklet<br/>
– Full-text Search bookmarked pages’ content, not just meta-data<br/>
– Attach searchable notes to bookmarks<br/>
– Choose between private or public bookmarks<br/>
– Find people like you and subscribe to their bookmarks<br/>
– Share your bookmarks with others<br/>
– Detect broken, forgotten and even redirected bookmarks<br/>
– Upload your existing bookmarks (Firefox, Mozilla, Netscape, Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera, Galeon and Konqueror supported)<br/>
– Export your bookmarks<br/>
– Access your bookmarks from any browser and multiple computers<br/>
– Save private, taggable, and searchable free-text Notes<br/>
– For hackers: Simpy has an open REST API – use it!<br/>
– For bloggers: Publish your bookmarks in your blog using RSS or ATOM</p>, <p>We’ve spoken with Otis GospodnetiÄ‡ by email over the last couple of weeks and have been told that <u>Simpy will be releasing new features sometime this week</u>. We look forward to seeing what’s coming!</p>, <p>In general, we find Simpy’s user interface and search capabilities superior to del.icio.us and Furl. We like the interface for adding bookmarks, and ask only that pages can be bookmarked via a popup like del.icio.us (as an option).

Profile – Shadows,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><em><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> Today is Social Bookmarking day, with profiles of <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=91"">Simpy</a> and now Shadows. Simpy went out on TechCrunch today because they’ve been releasing new functionality that we really like. Shadows has only been out for a couple of weeks, and will make a public appearance at the AlwaysOn conference at Stanford this week (say hello to me if you are there), and so we thought it was the right time to profile them as well.</em></p>, <p><strong>Service:</strong><a href=""http://www.shadows.com""> Shadows</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/shadowslogo.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Launched: </strong>Two weeks ago</p>, <p><strong>Located:</strong> Austin, TX (this is a <a href=""http://www.pluck.com/"">Pluck</a> company)</p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p><u>Pluck is up to something, and we like it</u>. Last week they released version 2.0 of their Firefox extension (see our <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=89"">profile</a>), which we are still drooling over (it’s <u>fast</u>). Two weeks ago they very quietly launched Shadows, which is a social bookmarking site. Our understanding from Dave Panos, their CEO, and Andrew Busey, the co-founder, is that they will be publicly announcing Shadows this week at AlwaysOn in Stanford.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/shadows1.gif""/></p>, <p>As we mentioned with <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=91"">Simpy</a>, Shadows should be compared to other social bookmarking sites like <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?cat=19"">del.icio.us</a>, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=30"">Furl</a>, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=56"">Yahoo My Web 2.0</a>, <a href=""http://www.consultantcommons.org/node/239"">and</a> <a href=""http://www.dlib.org/dlib/april05/hammond/04hammond.html"">others</a>.</p>, <p>Shadows has a single drawback: they absolutely require an IE or firefox toolbar installation in order to bookmark pages on the fly. This takes up valuable screen real estate and is generally annoying.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/shadows2.gif""/></p>, <p>However, the functionality more than makes up for the real estate loss – this is a toolbar we are going to <em>keep</em>, and there’s a good reason. Not only does the toolbar allow saving and tagging of pages, but it also allows you to view a “shadow page” of the current URI. The shadow page shows tags added by users, comments and other meta-data, which is very useful. Here is content from the shadow page for Techcrunch (which is somewhat biased since as of now we are the only user to have added meta-data for Techcrunch:-)):</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/shadows3.gif""/><br/>
<a href=""http://www.shadows.com/shadows.aspx?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.beta.techcrunch.com%2F"">Link</a></p>, <p>Shadows seems to have all of the high end functionality of the other social bookmarking services (with the exception of a server cache of the site?). One thing we haven’t figured out – there is an ability to add friends but we don’t know what functionality comes with adding friends since users set bookmars as either public or private. We like the delicious and furl-like popup up when bookmarking a page:</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/shadows4.gif""/></p>, <p>They also have shadow pages, as mentioned above, and a nifty feature called “<a href=""http://www.shadows.com/help/FAQ.aspx#23b"">ubertags</a>“, which are pre-defined tags like experts, cool, etc., many of which we have attributed to TechCrunch, of course.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/shadows5.gif""/></p>, <p>Overall, Shadows is very cool and we look forward to the official launch.</p>, <p><strong>Management:</strong></p>, <p>Dave Panos – Chief Executive Officer (co-founder)<br/>

There are two channels here – the main room with panel discussions (see schedule below) and a side room with 5 minute CEO pitches. CEO’s were judged on three areas of their presentations: Opportunity, Go to market strategy and Overall Presentation.</p>, <p>Both channels were interesting, and attendees were charging back and forth between rooms all day (us included).</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/alwaysontwo2.JPG""/><br/>
<strong><br/>
CEO Pitches:</strong></p>, <p>We saw about half of the CEO pitches.

If you are interested in hearing John Furrier’s interview with Mark, see <a href=""http://www.podtech.net/?p=76"">Podtech.net here</a>.</p>, <p>My notes from the Mark Cuban fireside chat:</p>, <p>IceRocket is being renamed blogscour.com. It looks like they are really focusing on prospective search. Mark discussed the differences in the way people search – some people want relevant information, some people want timely information. Google is good at “relevant”, but not timely. Blogscour will focus on timely.</p>, <p>Mark quote: <em>“when is the last time the government did something smart…with technology?ï¿½?</em> <em>“The only people with a worse track record is hollywood”</em></p>, <p>Allen Delattre, the moderator, said <em>“blogs are growing virally”</em>. That’s the first time I’ve heard it put that way. It’s certainly true (but see <a href=""http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/004940.html"">Jeremy Zavodny</a> yesterday – When will blogging peak?)</p>, <p>In the next segment, Mark spoke at length about delivering movies via dvd and in cinemas (and eventually online) all on the same day. This is definitely the future.</p>, <p>Mark said he’s learned the most about marketing from four people: Bill Gates, Paris Hilton, Dennis Rodman and Michael Dell.</p>, <p>Mark is a good guy and an interesting guy and it was cool having him at the event yesterday.</p>, <p>Looking forward to Marc Canter’s <a href=""http://marc.blogs.it/archives/2005/07/today_is_a_big.html"">GoingOn</a> discussion today.</p>, <p><strong>Relevant Links:</strong></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.alwayson-network.com/ao2005/"">Schedule</a>, <a href=""http://www.newmediamusings.com/blog/2005/07/more_photos_fro.html"">New Media Musings</a>, <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/alwayson/"">Flickr AlwaysOn</a>, <a href=""http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/001564.html"">Infectuous Greed</a></p>, <p><span class=""technoratitag""><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/tags/alwayson"" rel=""tag"">alwayson</a>, <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/tags/ao2005"" rel=""tag"">ao2005</a>, <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/tags/ao100"" rel=""tag"">ao100</a>, <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/tags/web2.0"" rel=""tag"">web2.0</a>, <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/tags/techcrunch"" rel=""tag"">techcrunch</a>, <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/tags/stanford"" rel=""tag"">stanford</a></span></p>]"

However in 2003/2004, one of the websites, MySpace.com started to take-off thanks to the social networking craze.</em></p>, <p>As I outlined earlier, unlike Friendster and its clones, MySpace took a unique approach to the Social Networking space and concentrated heavily on building a community first (centered around music and bands), and a social network second.

Launched:</strong> July 21, 2005 (estimated)</p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>FeedShake is a website that creates a single RSS feed from multiple RSS feeds. You can also filter out posts that contain specified keywords, and/or filter in posts only if they contain specified keywords. The site is incredibly easy to use (it takes mere moments to create an aggregated feed) and no registration or email address is required.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/feedshake1.gif""/></p>, <p>Similar services are listed by libary clips <a href=""http://libraryclips.blogsome.com/2005/05/20/rss-filter-and-re-mix/"">here</a>. According to Library Clips, <em>“Actually this tool is quite unique as it is the first to do both splicing and filteringâ€¦there are many blending tools, but ReFilter seems to be the only standalone filtering toolâ€¦here are other general filtering tools.”</em> (<a href=""http://libraryclips.blogsome.com/2005/07/25/feedshake-slurp-your-own-flavour/"">Link</a>)</p>, <p>The feed is auto-named “FeedShake” but can of course be renamed in your reader to whatever you want. It would be nice to be able to auto-rename the feed when it’s created so that other users would have the title you selected.</p>, <p>Other current limitations: <em>“This service is beta. Currently it supports RSS 2.0 feeds”</em></p>, <p>We’d be happy to pay for naming and stats on the feed. :-)</p>, <p>We tested the service by burning a combined feed of TechCrunch and <a href=""http://www.earningscast.com"">EarningsCast</a>, another Archimedes blog.

Between the little compass in VE that you can drag and itâ€™ll just scroll with you (instead of Google Mapsâ€™ â€œclick, drag, click, drag, click, drag”) and the ability to zoom much more easily in VE (you can scroll, you can hit the +/- keys on your keyboard OR you can double click), this is an app that is much more thought out.ï¿½?</em></p>, <p>â€œAt the same time, Virtual Earth is much easier to use from an â€œexploringï¿½? point of view. Hop off a plane, hit â€œLocate Me”, look for rental cars, then look for hotels, then look for somewhere to eat and then look for somewhere to catch a show.

<strong><br/>
What is it?</strong></p>, <p>Konfabulator was <a href=""http://blogs.siliconvalley.com/gmsv/2005/07/interesting_mov.html"">acquired by Yahoo</a> yesterday.</p>, <p>In their own words, <em>“Konfabulator is a JavaScript runtime engine for Windows and Mac OS X that lets you run little files called Widgets that can do pretty much whatever you want them to. Widgets can be alarm clocks, calculators, can tell you your WiFi signal strength, will fetch the latest stock quotes for your preferred symbols, and even give your current local weather.”</em> <a href=""http://www.konfabulator.com/info/"">Link</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/konfabulatorhome.gif""/></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/konfabulatoryahoo.gif""/></p>, <p>Konfabulator was originally launched on February 10, 2003, for Mac only. A Windows version launched in November 2004.</p>, <p>Konfabulator required a download and works on both the Mac and Windows platforms. The Mac download is 5.4 mb, and the Windows download is 10 mb. The service previously required a fee but is now free.</p>, <p>Set up was quick and very easy after the download. Basically, it runs small applications on your desktop (there are <a href=""http://www.widgetgallery.com/"">thousands</a> to choose from).</p>, <p>I like the calculator, sticky notes and RSS reader the best (although I cannot figure out how to configure the RSS reader to stop showing USA Today, and gave up). There are also widgets for weather, batter power, and just about everything else you can think of. A few are automatically downloaded with the installation, but they are easily removed and others are easily added simply by downloading them (they install into the correct directory automatically).</p>, <p>Widgets can easily be moved around the desktop, customized, and delted entirely.</p>, <p>There are <a href=""http://www.konfabulator.com/workshop"">tools</a> to allow anyone to easily create their own widgets as well.</p>, <p>Konfabulator looks and feels very similar to Dashboard on OSX for the Mac, although some people claim creating widgets is easier on Konfabulator.</p>, <p>Overall, it’s cool but it will be uninstalled by the end of the evening.

In a nutshell, their goal is to help you find content that you will enjoy based on how you rate content you’ve already absorbed. The idea is awesome, and their approach is perfect (centralized website, plus distributed services to content providers) .</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/loomia1.gif""/></p>, <p>As with most successful web 2.0 companies, they are leveraging their users to create their core value. Users rate content. Loomia compares a user’s ratings and recommends other content that they should also enjoy.</p>, <p>For instance, if I like <a href=""http://www.podtech.net"">Podtech</a> (which I do),  and if other people who like Podtech also like <a href=""http://www.earningscast.com"">Earningscast</a> (an <a href=""http://www.archimedesventures.com"">Archimedes Ventures</a> company), Loomia will recommend that I also check out Earningscast.</p>, <p>Netflix takes a similar approach to recommending movies. My experience as the CEO of Zip.ca (a movie renting company in Canada) with similar recommendation features proved to me how powerful these recommendations can be. It is a hugely powerful way of connecting like minded people to like minded content.</p>, <p>Loomia isn’t planning on keeping all of this data to themselves. A core part of their business model will be working with other companies (think odeo as well as podtech) to allow those services to add ratings, recommendations and other features. If Loomia gets in the middle of this data stream, they could have a very bright future ahead of them.</p>, <p>Loomia is just getting started and the site reflects this. However, they have an awesome team (see below) and the core feature set is there. I recommend you give it a try. Mark, Loomia’s CEO, has promised to let me know when new features are added, and we will update their profile here at TechCrunch.</p>, <p><strong>Additional Screen Shots:</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/loomia4.gif""/></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/loomia3.gif""/></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/loomia2.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Team:</strong></p>, <p>David Marks, Co-Founder and CEO<br/>

A Tag Cloud is a more visual representation of your tags and their usage distribution. Along with the Tag Cloud come the 4 new Tag functions: remove, rename, split, and merge. These 4 functions will let you mess with your tags to your heart’s content. If they are not enough, I’m all ears.”</p>]"

The more widely our readers collect certain stories, the more prominently they will appear on our Web site.</em></p>, <p>If you imagine the mainstream media exists at one extreme of top-down content control where a small group of editors determine what appears in the News, CommonTimes is exactly the opposite â€“ a bottom up news site at which grassroots Web readers determine the top stories by bookmarking them as they browse.</p>, <p>Comparatively, CommonTimes is to news what Del.icio.us and Yahooâ€™s MyWeb are to Internet bookmarks. Contrary to Google News, a closed, automated system limited to mainstream media stories, CommonTimes is an open community system that accepts content from any news site or blog â€“ and is entirely driven by our readers. For example, while Slashdot and Grist Magazine provide a tightly controlled top-down filter of technology and environmental news that only rarely makes the mainstream media, our sections provide a bottom-up view of stories our readers feel are important from any source which may well integrate stories from the latter.</p>, <p>News it what our community decides is news.”</p>]"

In our opinion they aren’t quite ready to take on the <a href=""http://www.technorati.com"">king of blog search</a> yet, but they are feature rich and doing some things very, very well.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/icerocket1.gif""/></p>, <p>There are two ways that people are comparing blog search engines today: total links for a given keyword or tag, and total links shown for a given blog. On both tests, IceRocket seems to be doing well (but <a href=""http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/07/17.html#a10670"">not always</a>). On the links into TechCrunch, IceRocket seems to be far and away the most up-to-date, <u>this week</u> (things change rapidly in the real-time-web).</p>, <p>IceRocket has a ton of great search and other tools, including search by <a href=""http://blogs.icerocket.com/search?q=techcrunch"">keywords</a>, <a href=""http://blogs.icerocket.com/search?q=tag%3Atechcrunch"">tags</a> (see their tag cloud <a href=""http://blogs.icerocket.com/tag/"">here</a>) and <a href=""http://blogs.icerocket.com/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.beta.techcrunch.com"">URLs</a>.</p>, <p>They also have a <a href=""http://trend.icerocket.com/"">trends</a> service (see pre-defined trend competitions <a href=""http://www.icerocket.com/c?p=morebuzz"">here</a>), and hell, they even have <a href=""http://mail.icerocket.com"">email</a> (when I was COO of GNR in London I sold one of our companies, NamePlanet, to <a href=""http://www.netidentity.com/"">NetIdentity</a>, another Mark Cuban company which powers this). Finally, they also have a<a href=""http://www.icerocket.com/c?p=toolbar""> toolbar</a>, which is awesome if you aren’t like me and still have enough browser real estate left to actually view web pages.</p>, <p>Basically, IceRocket is awesome. One area where they really shine is in search results. A result includes tons of useful links. In addition to a link to the source, there are also links to tags for the result, the blog itself, tools to refine the search to include or exclude that blog, number of links to the blog (for relevance and ego), and they even link to the RSS feed for the blog. All search results pages have RSS feeds.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/icerocket2.gif""/></p>, <p>Another fun tool is <a href=""http://www.icerocket.com/icespy"">IceSpy</a>, which shows a rolling list of incoming search terms (all linked). This reminds me of the flat screen in Google’s offices that shows incoming searches (although Google appears to filter out adult terms while IceRocket happily does not :-)  ).</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/icerocket3.gif""/></p>, <p>They are changing their blog search engine name to BlogScour sometime in the near future.</p>, <p>We’ve also seen an <a href=""http://www.technoogle.com/?p=28"">increasing trend</a> by bloggers to tag their posts with IceRocket tags in addition to Technorati Tags.<br/>

The current Gmail storage limitation is 2 gigs.</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/gmaildrive1.gif""/></p>, <p>In their own words, <em>“GMail Drive is a Shell Namespace Extension that creates a virtual filesystem around your Google Gmail account, allowing you to use Gmail as a storage medium.</em></p>, <p>GMail Drive creates a virtual filesystem on top of your Google Gmail account and enables you to save and retrieve files stored on your Gmail account directly from inside Windows Explorer. GMail Drive literally adds a new drive to your computer under the My Computer folder, where you can create new folders, copy and drag’n’drop files to.</p>, <p>Ever since Google started to offer users a Gmail e-mail account, which includes storage space of 2000 megabytes, you have had plenty of storage space but not a lot to fill it up with. With GMail Drive you can easily copy files to your Gmail account and retrieve them again.<br/>
When you create a new file using GMail Drive, it generates an e-mail and posts it to your account. The e-mail appears in your normal Inbox folder, and the file is attached as an e-mail attachment. GMail Drive periodically checks your mail account (using the Gmail search function) to see if new files have arrived and to rebuild the directory structures. But basically GMail Drive acts as any other hard-drive installed on your computer.<br/>
You can copy files to and from the GMail Drive folder simply by using drag’n’drop like you’re used to with the normal Explorer folders.”</p>]"

Tel: (+603) 9283 6054</p>, <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>, <p>BlinkList is a social bookmarking service built on ajax.  It is very buttoned up and has some excellent features. It also has an all-star team with deep experience, led by their PR star (see team below) :-).</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/blinklist1.gif""/></p>, <p>We’ve profiled a number of competing services lately – see <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=92"">Shadows</a>, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?cat=19"">del.icio.us</a>, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=109"">Simpy</a>, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=30"">Furl</a>, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=56"">Yahoo My Web 2.0</a> <a href=""http://www.consultantcommons.org/node/239"">and</a> <a href=""http://www.dlib.org/dlib/april05/hammond/04hammond.html"">others</a>.</p>, <p>Blinklist includes most of the features from those sites, and adds a couple of others.<br/>
<strong><br/>
Key Features:</strong></p>, <p>– easy bookmarking, including a <a href=""http://www.blinklist.com/users/thankyou"">bookmarklet</a> if you want to have one-click bookmarks<br/>
– adding “stars” to tags and bookmarks to easily find them in the future</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/blinklist6.gif""/></p>, <p>– Blinklist will take any highlighted text on the screen and auto fill a description field with the text (this is the only service I know of that does this, and it’s incredibly useful)</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/blinklist3.gif""/></p>, <p>– bookmarks can be private or public. You can email bookmarks to friends at the time of making them, which is also a very useful feature. TechCrunch bookmarks are <a href=""http://www.blinklist.com/techcrunch/"">here</a>.<br/>
– permanent tag pages – see for example <a href=""http://www.blinklist.com/tag/web2.0/"">www.blinklist.com/tag/web2.0/</a> (a nested/filtered search function on general tag search would be an awesome addition – <a href=""http://www.shadows.com"">Shadows</a> has a “narrow results” option that is very useful)<br/>
– a tag cloud for each user, as well as the entire blinklist community</p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/blinklist5.gif""/></p>, <p>– “related tags” for currently viewed tags<br/>
– “auto-complete” suggestions when tagging a bookmark<br/>
– RSS for all pages<br/>
– easy signup</p>, <p>see the demo <a href=""http://www.blinklist.com/Theme/Media/BlinkCNN.htm"">here</a> to see some of these features being used.</p>, <p>Overall, BlinkList is a worthy addition to the ranks of social bookmarking services, and one of our favorites. It doesn’t have the user base of del.cio.us, or all of the functionality of Shadows or Simpy, but it does have unique features that none of the others have. It could very easily get traction.</p>, <p><strong>Suggested new features:</strong></p>, <p>– full page caching with keyword search<br/>
– shadow-page type functionality (this is going to really help with search engine rankings for Pluck, and it’s cool).<br/>
– nested/tag filtering at all levels<br/>
– show number of people who’ve bookmared a given URI</p>, <p><strong>Additional Screen Shots:</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/blinklist2.gif""/></p>, <p><img alt="""" border=""1/"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/blinklist4.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Team:</strong></p>, <p>Vishen M.

They’ll invite you.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/xmhd2.gif"" width=""210px""/></p>, <p>XMHD is similar to <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=113"">Gmail Drive</a>, which we profiled yesterday. However, whereas Gmail Drive is an actual virtual drive on your Windows machine (and only windows), XMHD runs everything on its website and is therefore platform independent. All you need is a web browser and a gmail account to use it.</p>, <p>There is also no account registration or download. Simply give it your gmail credentials and it logs into the gmail account for you and shows you its own front end.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/xmhd3.gif"" width=""210px""/></p>, <p>In their own words, <em>“How does XmailHardDrive.com work? XmailHardDrive.com directly connects with your Gmail account to then turn it into a portable virtual hard drive that you can access from anywhere in the world.  You simply enter your Gmail username and password, just like the other third party software, and then using the username and password combination it authenticates with the Gmail servers and connects you to your personal account.  Therefore allowing the user to be able to upload files to their Gmail account. Next when the user uploads a file, the file is uploaded as an e-mail attachment in their Gmail inbox, this file however is encrypted and compressed which enables the user to store more files since it is compressed.  The file is then saved as an .xmhd file which can be decompressed and re-downloaded through XmailHardDrive.com.  And now with the FlingIt feature the user can send the file they just uploaded to a friend that has a Gmail account.  Currently the max file upload size is 20mb however as we gain more sponsors we will remove the upload limit, and you’ll be able to upload much much larger files!”</em> <a href=""http://www.xmailharddrive.com/beta/about.xmhd"">Link</a></p>, <p>You can easily add files from your hard drive (or other connected drive). You can upload up to 10 files at a time.</p>, <p>Files are compressed and stored in a proprietary .xmhd format, but can be double clicked and opened in their original format from the site (and saved, edited, etc.). There is also a cool “fling it” feature that emails a file to any gmail contact stored in the gmail account. If the person doens’t have a gmail account, they will have to get one and use xmhd to open the file. All of this is a bit of a hassle for email recipients – and although XMHD says that their file format is necessary for compression purposes (and therefore you can store more data on your gmail account), it is also a nice viral touch to the service because recipients of your file must log in to XMHD to view them. You can always of course, simply email your files directly as well, so its not a big deal and it is a nice feature.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/xmhd4.gif"" width=""210px""/></p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/xmhh5.gif"" width=""210px""/></p>, <p>We also like the upcoming RSS feed into your XMHD:</p>, <p><em>“XmailHardDrive.com is now in the process of building an RSS feed for your XmailHardDrive, which will allow developers to build applications that interact with your XmailHardDrive. We are also working on a Gmail notifier program capable of so much more than what the Gmail Notifier from Google can do. Stay tuned to the website for when these products will be released.”</em><br/>
<a href=""http://www.xmailharddrive.com/beta/"">Link</a></p>, <p>Overall its a great service, completely free, and just a bit better than Gmail Drive due to its cross-platform nature and “fling it” service.</p>, <p><span class=""technoratitag""><strong>Tags: </strong><a href=""http://www.technorati.com/tags/xmhd"" rel=""tag"">xmhd</a>, <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/tags/xmailharddrive"" rel=""tag"">xmailharddrive</a>, <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/tags/xmail"" rel=""tag"">xmail</a>, <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/tags/gmailharddrive"" rel=""tag"">gmailharddrive</a>, <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/tags/gmaildrive"" rel=""tag"">gmaildrive</a>, <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/tags/google"" rel=""tag"">google</a>, <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/tags/gmail"" rel=""tag"">gmail</a>, <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/tags/storage"" rel=""tag"">storage</a>, <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/tags/techcrunch"" rel=""tag"">techcrunch</a>, <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/tags/web2.0"" rel=""tag"">web2.0</a></span></p>]"
Jyve,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">Jyve is a set of applications that enhance Skype. I eventually had to tear myself away from the site because I kept finding new tools and features, but the core functionality can be summarized into four categories:</p>, <p><img alt=""Jyve"" class=""shot clear"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/jyve.jpg""/></p>, <p>As far as I can tell, Jyve is only available for Windows at this time. To use Jyve’s advanced applications, you must be running Skype v.1.3 or later. There is a small (1.3 mb) download. Here is a breakdown of the applications and what they do:</p>, <p>You can view these tools <a href=""http://plugin.jyve.com/?fuse=webtool"">here</a>, and a feature showcase <a href=""http://plugin.jyve.com/?fuse=demo"">here</a>.</p>, <p>There are a number of code snippets on this page that you can put on a website and allow website visitors to interact with you in different ways.  For instance, the button below shows whether or not I am online with Skype, and clicking on it calls me (I’m trusting you people not to abuse this button :-)).</p>, <p><a href=""//marrington""><img border=""0"" src=""http://www.skypepresence.com/marrington.png""/></a></p>, <p>The tools include CallTO (calls), IMTO (sends an instant message), send voicemail, create conference call, etc. These features will be extremely useful on intranets, wiki’s, etc. There is an “all in one” feature that creates a Jyve/Skype Card for you and that contains all of the features.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/jyve3.gif"" width=""210px""/> You can use this tool to share a browser screen with other Skype users. None of my contacts are online right now since it’s the middle of the damn night (even the Jyve guys that I’ve been chatting with, Andrew Hansen and Gabe Morris, are offline – wake up so that we can look at TechCrunch together via Jyve! :-)), so I’m making an assumption that it works.</p>, <p>I like this stuff, and I hope that Jyve adds additional productivity tools over time – sharing any application would be perfect. Powerpoint is the obvious one.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/jyve5.gif"" width=""210px""/> This is a set of options that will leave auto-responses via IM or voice if you are away, on a call, etc. This is useful. But on a sidenote, I’ve come to the conclusion that it is fine if you don’t respond immediately to an IM – many times people are just sending you some information to consider and don’t necessarily want or expect an immediate response. But I digress…</p>, <p>This is the good stuff for me as a user. When a Skype call comes in, you can set it to ring your home phone, forward to a cell phone, or forward to another skype name. Call forwarding requires SkypeOut (a pre-paid thing with skype that allows you to call normal phone numbers). This is really really cool. The only problem is that you must be logged in to Skype for it to work, and the time I most need calls forwarded is when I’m offline. This is a Skype issue, not a Jyve issue, and I’m sure Jyve will change this if/when Skype adds the functionality.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/jyve4.gif"" width=""210px""/></p>, <p>That’s it! Like I said, there is lots of other functionality on the site but this seems to be the main group of applications. For heave Skype users, Jyve is a wonderful product. And it is clear that they intend to evolve these products, and release new ones, in the future.</p>, <p><strong>Additional Links: </strong> <a href=""http://blog.tmcnet.com/blog/tom-keating/voip/jive-talking.asp"">Tom Keating</a>, <a href=""http://blog.qumana.com/blog/_archives/2005/7/21/1060872.html"">Tris Hussey</a>, <a href=""http://www.skypejournal.com/blog/archives/2005/07/jyve_web_tags.php"">Stuart Henshall #1</a>, <a href=""http://www.skypejournal.com/blog/archives/2005/07/jyve_now_we_are.php"">Stuart Henshall #2</a>,  <a href=""http://www.skypejournal.com/blog/archives/2005/07/jyve_-_skype_fo.php"">Stuart Henshall #3</a>, <a href=""http://www.skypejournal.com/blog/archives/2005/07/the_jyve_-_skyp.php"">Stuart Henshall #4</a>, <a href=""http://www.skypejournal.com/blog/archives/2005/07/skype_interacti.php"">Stuart Henshall #5</a>, <a href=""http://www.corante.com/getreal/archives/2005/07/20/a_fragmented_instant_messaging_world_an_end_in_skype.php"">Stowe Boyd</a>, <a href=""http://blog.23corner.com/2005/07/20/955/"">23corner</a>, <a href=""http://fgiasson.com/blog/index.php?title=testing_skype_another_way_to_contact_me&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1"">Fred on Something</a>, <a href=""http://zog.typepad.com/malaysia/2005/07/forward_your_sk_1.html"">Jan in Malaysia</a>, <a href=""http://www.mobile-weblog.com/50226711/for_those_stationary_moments.php"">Mobile Weblog</a>, <a href=""http://incsub.org/soulsoup/index.php?p=497"">Soul Soup</a>,  <a href=""http://www.nevon.net/nevon/2005/07/manage_your_onl.html"">Neville Hobson</a>, <a href=""http://www.connectedinternet.co.uk/blog/_archives/2005/7/20/1051935.html"">Connected Internet</a>, <a href=""http://solokay.blogspot.com/2005/07/call-forwarding-for-skype.html"">Solomon’s VOIP World</a>,  <a href=""http://www.baeyens.net/baeyens/view.php?id=1235"">Bayens.net</a>, <a href=""http://www.zylstra.org/blog/archives/001727.html"">Ton’s Interdependent Thoughts</a></p>]"

Simply Hired</a> is a vertical search engine for jobs and can be compared to <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=127"">Indeed</a>, its primary competitor. Yesterday, Simply Hired <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/press-financing.html"">announced</a> that it raised $3 million in new captial from Rajeev Motwani, Ron Conway, Kanwal Rekhi and Garage Technology Ventures. The company had previously raised $1.2 million from its founders. Guy Kawasaki also joined their board of directors.</p>, <p>Much like Indeed, Simply Hired gathers job postings from a huge set of sites, including Monster, the Wall Street Journal, CareerBuilder, Hotjobs, craigslist and others. Simply Hired then structures the data in the postings and allows its users to search for specific keywords, titles, companies, locations, etc.</p>, <p>Searches can be further refined, including by freshness of the posting and by lists like “fortune 500”. Once a user has the final search result set that they want, future job postings meeting the search criteria can be delivered to the user via RSS and/or email alerts.</p>, <p><img alt=""""/>One interesting feature is the ability to rate a posting, with 1-5 stars. Their idea is to generate enough user rating content to be able to recommend job postings to you, based on how you’ve rated other postings (and how other users have rated those postings). See our profile on <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=107"">Loomia</a> – they are doing something similar in the podcasting space.</p>, <p>To round things out, Simply hired has promotional snippets for your website <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com/builder.php"">here</a>, and a corporate blog <a href=""http://blog.simplyhired.com/"">here.</a> (sans comments).</p>, <p>I actually can’t say if I can pick between Indeed and Simply Hired. Both changed the jobs game permanently (as witnessed by Hotjobs changing their model to incorporate other listings). <u>Both are excellent.</u></p>, <p><img alt=""""/><a href=""http://www.simplyfired.com/"">Simply Fired</a> is a <a href=""http://blog.simplyhired.com/archives/2005/08/if_you_dont_lau.php"">sister</a> site to Simply Hired that is centered around <a href=""http://www.simplyfired.com/feature.php"">Mark Jen</a>, the 22 year old who was fired from Google for being incredibly stupid. The idea with Simply Fired is that you write the story of how you were fired, and win prizes if it’s considered one of the best. I tried to find a good story to link to but they are all pretty obvious – sleeping with bosses daughter, ran over bosses foot, etc. Some of them may even be true.</p>, <p>I have deep respect for this as a nice viral marketing tool (sort of), but <a href=""http://www.fuckedcompany.com"">FuckedCompany</a> is a much better read.</p>, <p>But back to Simply Hired, it is a beautiful site with meaningful results, and definitely a cool web 2.0 business.</p>, <p>Gautam Godhwani, Founder/CEO<br/>

Profile – Chalk,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">In a short but interesting announcement, <a href=""http://www.chalk.it"">Chalk</a> was introduced to the world. Chalk is a Ruby on Rails and Ajax-powered web application to collaborative manage your daily life. Quoting the introduction:</p>, <p>Designers, programmers, writers, family, friends – anyone. We all want tools that make us more productive, especially when we’re working in groups. Chalk gives any team an immediate, real time collaborative environment thats accessible from any computer in the world. Do you want to share your ideas, code or graphics instantaneously with others? Chalk is already changing the way we work, and we’re sure it will for you.</p>, <p><img alt=""Chalk Interface"" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/chalkinterface.jpg"" style=""float:left;margin-right:10px;"" width=""210px""/>One thing they stress on the announcement is that they’re doing things the web 2.0 way, by adding a social network layer to the software and having an extra edge on interaction by using Ajax. We’ll be looking forward to checking Chalk out as soon as there’s more information on it.</p>, <p>There are other applications set to do similar things so if life-management is your coup-du-jour you may want to have a look at <a href=""http://www.backpackit.com"">Backpack</a> and the upcoming <a href=""http://writeboard.com/"">Writeboard</a> too.

Profile – YorZ,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">YorZ (pronounced “Y” “or” “Z”, but the founders <a href=""http://www.yorz.com/help.htm#yorz"">aren’t uptight</a> about it) is a job referral site that pays bounties to people who refer the person who becomes employed. It is very early stage but nevertheless has an interesting business model and a <a href=""http://www.yorz.com/team.htm"">very smart team</a> of founders and employees.</p>, <p>I spoke with the two founders today, Brian Goler and Kevin Berk, and got a very good feel for their business. Additional features are promised soon.</p>, <p>YorZ allows companies to post jobs (with or without a bounty), people to refer others for jobs, and people to apply directly for jobs. Their listings are available on their site, and they also syndicate listings out to <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=128"">Simply Hired</a>, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=127"">Indeed</a> and other job posting aggregators.</p>, <p>Employers pay a $10 fee per listing, althought that fee is waived if the employer chooses to pay a success-based bounty of $50 or more. The bounty, which is paid only if an employee is successfully sourced through YorZ and begins working, is paid directly to YorZ, which then distributes it out to the referrer or referrers of that candidate. The employer is asked to leave feedback (on a scale of 1-5) of referrers and candidates.</p>, <p>YorZ syndicates their listings out to various free aggregators, and will also post the listings on paid sites such as Monster on behalf of the employer (passing on the fees).</p>, <p><img alt=""""/> People who want to refer jobs to others have a couple of tools to use. They can send emails directly to the company and/or the person being referred or they can set up a “<a href=""http://www.yorz.com/bountyRollForm.htm"">Bounty Roll</a>” on their website. The Bounty Roll is a widget that you install on any web page that lists job postings according to filters you set, such as keyword, bounty size, location, etc. You can also choose the number of listings to be shows, from 1-10. YorZ creates an easy to use html snippet for you to use, based on your parameters. If there are any successful hires through your Bounty Roll links, you get paid the bounty (suggestion: add a search box to the Bounty Roll)</p>, <p>Bounties are paid if a person you referred first takes a job and begins working. If your email is forwarded (creating a <a href=""http://www.yorz.com/help.htm#referral-chain"">Referral Chain</a>), the last six referrers share the bounty equally.</p>, <p>If you are paid bounties of $600 or more in a calendar year, YorZ will submit a form 1099 to the IRS.</p>, <p>Applicants can apply directly for a job, of course. If there is no referrer, YorZ keeps the bounty for themselves.</p>, <p>YorZ is a great idea and could get traction. The service is naturally viral (emails to people you refer as well as the Bounty Roll). We also like that they have RSS feeds and email alerts for all categories and search results.  Their competitors include <a href=""http://karmaone.org/"">KarmaOne</a>, <a href=""http://www.mkt10.com/Main/default.aspx"">Mkt10</a> and <a href=""http://www.headlesshunter.com"">HeadlessHunter</a>.</p>, <p>Brian Goler – Co-Founder<br/>

Profile – Blinksale,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""""/>Want an easier way to manage invoices? <a href=""http://www.blinksale.com/"">Blinksale</a> is for you. And even if invoices aren’t a problem for you, take a minute and check out their site. It is visually and functionally <u>stunning</u>. It oozes AJAX and Rails, and thoughtful, creative design. That’s not surprising, since a design company specializing in AJAX, <a href=""http://www.firewheeldesign.com/web/"">Firewheel Design</a>, created the site. But it is also wonderfully easy to use – the features are not just there to visually impress. I love it, and I never send invoices.</p>, <p>Blinksale tackles a simple need in a straightforward way. Invoices are always a hassle for small businesses. You either need to hack up a Word or Excel document and forward it, or use expensive accounting software. Some people just send text invoices in email. It’s not very pretty, and unless you are using accounting software there are few or no tools to help you follow up and manage invoices after they are sent.</p>, <p>Blinksale solves all of this. First, it takes moments to create and send a very professional invoice. I literally registered a new account, created a faux invoice and sent it to my partner at Archimedes Ventures, Keith Teare, in about 5 minutes (I billed him $25,000 for “services” – let’s see if the deadbeat pays).</p>, <p>Blinksale currently supports 160 currencies. You can include your <a href=""http://www.blinksale.com/blog/invoices/000028.html"">paypal information</a> in the invoice and be paid by that method, if you can do business with paypal (in my opinion the world is divided firmly into two types of people: people who’ve used paypal for one year or less, and people who’ve been ripped off by paypal and subsequently have been ignored and/or berated by paypal “customer service”). By the way, after registration, blinksale creates a unique home page for you – ours is techcrunch.blinksale.com.</p>, <p><img alt=""""/>After creating an invoice, there are a number of management tools at your disposal.</p>, <p>First, Mac users can sync their invoices with iCal. For the rest of us, an xml feed is available and you can subscribe to invoices via RSS. <a href=""http://www.blinksale.com/blog/reminders_and_thank_yous/000031.html"">Reminders</a> and <a href=""http://www.blinksale.com/blog/reminders_and_thank_yous/000030.html"">Thank You</a> notes can be sent to clients. Paid invoices can be marked as paid and closed out.</p>, <p>Blinksale has a number of <a href=""http://www.blinksale.com/subscribe.html"">account options</a>, ranging from free to $29/month. The paid plans all have a 30 day free trial, and there is no minimum period (and no refunds for termination before the end of a month). The paid plans allow for customized templates (using CSS), more users, more invoices, more clients, etc.</p>, <p>Put simply, receiving payment for services performed or goods sold is why most of us work. While many small business owners, contractors, and freelancers enjoy the work they perform, most of us would rather be skiing. Or on a lake. Or in front of a 60-inch plasma TV. We work so we can get paid. And if we get paid enough, perhaps we won’t have to work as much. Getting paid for your services should be easy, painless, and quick. This is why we created Blinksale. <a href=""http://www.firewheeldesign.com/sparkplug/2005/July/the_blinksale_manifesto.php"">Link</a></p>, <p>For futher reading, the Blinksale blog is <a href=""http://www.blinksale.com/blog/index.html"">here</a>, and the  Firewheel Design blog is <a href=""http://www.firewheeldesign.com/sparkplug/"">here</a>.

Profile – Zopa,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.zopa.com"">Zopa</a>, based in London, is a lending network. Zopa synidicates loans requested by “borrower” members out to “lender” members, based on criteria and parameters set by both parties.</p>, <p>Zopa stands for “Zone of Possible Agreement”, which “is the overlap between one personâ€™s bottom line (the lowest theyâ€™re prepared to get for something) and another personâ€™s top line (the most theyâ€™re prepared to give for something). Itâ€™s the way people negotiate all sorts of stuff – buying a car, getting a mortgage – even a teenager negotiating with parents about staying out late. If thereâ€™s no Zopa, thereâ€™s no deal.”</p>, <p>Zopa is the first lending and borrowing exchange. What we do is very simple. We put people who want to lend in touch with credit-worthy people who want to borrow. And because there’s no middle-man – the borrower pays just a 1% exchange fee to Zopa upfront – both benefit.</p>, <p>We’re not sure about the “no middle-man” argument since Zopa is, in effect, acting as a middle-man and taking a 1% cut, but the idea is brilliant nonetheless, and it certainly seems to make it easier for people to borrow small amounts of money at reasonable rates.</p>, <p><img alt=""""/>In order to lend or borrow, Zopa does a background and credit check on you to ensure that you are appropriate for their market. They attempt to do this online and with as little hassle to you as possible. Once you are approved you can lend or borrow money within various limits.</p>, <p>For instance, you may borrow from Â£1000 to Â£15000, in Â£500 increments. Lenders can loan a minimum of Â£500 and a maximum of Â£25,000. If you’d like to lend more than Â£25,000, you must obtain a license to become a “consumer lending business”. Zopa will help you through this process.</p>, <p>Zopa spreads the lending risk among many borrows to reduce overall loss risk. Contracts are set at Â£10 each and must be spread among at least 50 different borrowers. And Zopa aggresively pursues bad debts:</p>, <p><strong>How does Zopa deal with bad debts?</strong><br/>
If one of your borrowers defaults, Credit Resource Solutions Ltd, a collections agency, will undertake to recover any money outstanding. Should it be unable to do so after 120 days, you agree to sell the debt to a collections agency for a price that will be agreed at the time, but which will not be less than 10% of the amount then outstanding. The agency will pay a fixed percentage of the outstanding amount to us which we will pass back to you. We will not allow that borrower to borrow again and will suspend their membership. Furthermore, we will pass their details back to our credit referencing agency which may affect their ability to get credit in the future. </p>, <p>Zopa claims 16,000 registered members. Currently, Zopa is only open to U.K. residents who are more than 18 years old and have a bank account and personal Equifax credit rating.

Web 2.0 This Week (July 31 – Aug. 6),"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">A lot happened in our web 2.0 world this last week.

Profile – YouTube,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">YouTube is very much like flickr (<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=22"">profile</a>), but for videos. You can upload videos in a number of different formats ( .AVI, .MOV, and .MPG ). Videos can be of any length, but must be less than 100 mb in total size. Editorial restrictions consist of no “nudity and your video must be appropriate for all audiences.” (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/help.php"">link</a>). For additional requirements, see their <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/help.php"">help</a> page.</p>, <p><img alt=""""/>The service is completely free to users (publishers and viewers). YouTube converts video to a flash format, and therefore upload and playback is extremely fast. In our tests, videos uploaded significantly faster than in other services.</p>, <p>YouTube is also a sharing network. You can add friends who are also member of the network, and email any video to anyone. YouTube also provides easy to use copy/paste code for emailing and posting on a website. You can also tag your videos, which results in bunching in a very similar way as flickr. Overall, the service is excellent.</p>, <p>The service has recently been launched but seems to have quite a few users who have posted lots of content. Our absolute favorite is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/?v=PaluLFfv0EI"">Matt Dances around the World</a>. It shows an ex-programmer who’s travelling the world and dancing at famous locations – it’s awesome and very popular on the site. Other favorites are <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch.php?v=gt3NiITgL88"">this</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch.php?v=34vtFXKGc4Y"">this</a> (that’s me in the red shirt. ok, not) (how do people do this?).</p>, <p>I suspect YouTube will be quickly acquired and/or duplicated.

ASUS VX1 Lamborghini Notebook,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""asus-lamborghini-vx1.jpg"" class=""center"" src=""http://old.crunchgear.com/wp-content/uploads/asus-lamborghini-vx1.jpg""/>We’re not sure what kind of people buy Lamborghini-branded Notebooks.

Plus ça change,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""shot2"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/night.jpg""/>Holiday weekends, especially the ones that bracket the summer months, tend to be stress tests for the tech media. With the proliferation of smart phones, social media aggregators, and of course the Twitter clonestakes, it’s now trivial to get a snapshot of what is going on throughout the “time off.”</p>, <p>Is nothing going on? Has the TechMeme conversation dried up, as Robert Scoble entertainingly <a href=""http://scobleizer.com/2008/07/05/off-of-the-tech-entertainment-train/"">baits</a>? Are FriendFeed conversations more viral and link-inducing? Of course. There’s nothing like a few days off to cull the herd and make it achingly clear how parochial the “news” can become. But let’s use the quiet after the cherry bombs subside to measure how far or not we’ve come.</p>, <p>A year ago, we stood on line for the iPhone. Google Reader ruled the roost, the inheritor of the crest of the RSS wave where mainstream and insurgent media stood side by side and worked together to suck most of our online time away. We and our friends were complaining of information overload, the networks were complaining of YouTube sucking away their audiences, and the <a href=""http://www.techmeme.com/070705/h1100"">TechMeme talk</a> was, well, about Scoble’s post on being a month into Facebook and Twitter v. Pownce and Hugh Macleod on why the A-List is dead.</p>, <p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_Karr"">Plus ça change</a>. RSS becomes Twitter, Twitter breaks, Facebook becomes FriendFeed, Twitter breaks, Pownce becomes Identi.ca, Twitter breaks. Or as Scoble puts it, Twitter continues to suck less. No matter what the names of the guilty, our technology still keeps pushing at this problem of how to get the most valuable the quickest.</p>, <p>Notice I say valuable, not entertaining, not disruptive, not enterprise grade, not actionable, not even useful. Valuable to who? Someone whose judgment I respect, most often. Whether by force of words, or by element of surprise, or wit, or poetry, somehow the value cuts through the clutter more often than not. Over time, we build up confidence in these people, streams, and services. No wonder we take it so personally when they break.</p>, <p>Our language betrays our fear that this is all worthless, this pursuit of technology at all costs. We deride these tools as toys, not meant for real work or study. We talk of playing with this program, that service. We create lists to assign ranking and therefore credibility to these ephemeral “products”, argue about business models to justify the time and attention paid as though we better hurry up before the teacher gets back and grades us. In a world of options, we complain about violations of rules that haven’t been set yet.</p>, <p>Scoble’s genius is in letting us see ourselves in him. An entertainer in the purest sense of the word, he is brave enough to make mistakes as fast as he possibly can, so that we can synthesize that experience without having to admit we don’t know what we’re doing either. He asks the stupid questions for us. What happens to this thing when you have 2,000 friends. OK, 20,000. OK, 200,000. But for each us, he is one friend we can count on.</p>, <p>Of course, FriendFeed often feels more like Ex-FriendFeed as we struggle to find our bearings in this week’s model. Voices we’ve come to respect suddenly sour with competitive bile, others we long ago discounted suddenly start making sense again. We can explain away this volatility as the cost of the ease of entry to the conversation, the loss of the comfort of gatekeepers, the endowing of tenure as a member of the real media. It’s tough keeping a scorecard when we don’t even know what game we’re playing.</p>, <p>But over time the true spirits emerge. During the combat, we assign attributes to our opponents that reflect what we want to think about ourselves. Arrogant? We want ourselves to be fair, open to criticism, relaxed in our respect for others. Elitist? Obsessive? Dismissive? Intellectual? Stupid? You do the math.</p>, <p>Once the battle is done, we like to sit around the campfire and tell stories on ourselves, remembering this slight and that slip on this or that banana. All the serious anger and desperate struggle fades and is replaced by the recognition of our pettiness in others’ actions. Can we do better the next time? Chuckling, we doubt it, but somehow we grow up a little more each time.</p>, <p>A year ago, Scoble said this: “Anyway, I still like Twitter the best. Why?” Lightweight, the first thing on his cell phone, does only one thing. Today, it’s FriendFeed and Twitter “where the audience that I really care about is hanging out.” And he won’t be hanging out on line for the new iPhone: “But, waiting in line for an Apple product is glorious, even if it is idiotic. It’s certainly one way to get on <a href=""http://www.techmeme.com/080705/h1230"">Techmeme</a> without writing a blog.” Plus ça change!</p>]"

I spoke with <a href=""http://www.pheedo.com/company/management.html"">Bill Flitter</a>, Pheedo’s Chief Marketing Officer, earlier this week to get a better understanding of the business. Bill joined Pheedo as part of their <a href=""http://www.pheedo.info/archives/000056.html"">Series A financing</a>.</p>, <p>Advertisements are inserted into feeds and/or the blog itself. Today, ads are text-based, with graphical ads being rolled out in the near future.</p>, <p>11,000 blogs are currently part of the Pheedo network, some of which are very large. Pheedo classifies blogs as “premium” or as part of a category (basically a group of similar blogs). Traffic is one metric for determining if a blog is “premium” or not, but Bill emphasized that it is not the only factor. Many of their smallest publishers, serving a specific niche, get the best performance, he said.</p>, <p>Advertisers can target specific blogs and/or categories (topic based). Bloggers have control over whether or not they allow a specific advertiser to place ads on in their feeds and/or on their blogs.</p>, <p>Pheedo started as a simple idea to help thousands of bloggers, micro-publishers and large media outlets in need of a flexible advertising solution. Our aim is to provide publishers and advertisers alike the tools needed capitalize on the business opportunities surrounding weblogs and syndicated content feeds.</p>, <p>We are rethinking online advertising and delivering new tools to address the opportunities and challenges of this 100% opt-in, consumer-controlled, syndicated content and blog medium. We are excited to deliver the service you expect.</p>, <p>And most importantly, your feedback is always welcome. <a href=""http://www.pheedo.com/company/"">Link</a></p>, <p>For bloggers, getting set up through Pheedo is relatively simple. They will set up a new feed URL for you. Alternatively, if you have a current feed with subscribers, they have tools to assist you in redirecting the URL to flow through Pheedo. There are no minimum traffic requirements to work with them.</p>, <p>Advertisements are generally priced on a cpc (cost per click) basis. Advertisers also have a choice of offering a sponsorship – which is a set price on a blog or category to have an advertisement shown for a specific period of time.</p>, <p>Click through rates on feeds is fairly high – 5-15% on average according to Bill. See their <a href=""http://www.pheedo.info/archives/cat_case_study.html"">case study here</a> comparing feed click through rates to email marketing. Pheedo currently serves their own ads, and uses Kanoodle to back-fill unsold inventory.</p>, <p>Pheedo gives 65% of advertising revenue to the blog publisher.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.reasonableman.com/"">Charles Smith</a>, President | COO<br/>

Consumating</a> is dating 2.0. Yes, it’s <em>dating with tags</em>. They also use a bit of Ajax in their interface.</p>, <p>After registering (it’s free), you create an online profile.

For instance, they refer to everyone you might meet on their site as “prospective ex-partners”. Nice.</p>, <p>You can also add tags for other people, and leave comments.

The team focused on the basics of reading and sending mail. Mail beta is a work-in-progress and a large number of beta users are driving what it becomes (we can barely keep up with all their ideasâ€¦)</p>, <p>Hereâ€™s the first of some of my favorite things about reading mails in mail beta:</p>, <p>1. Fast, faster and faster still Mail beta is significantly faster, I mean by an order of magnitude:<br/>
a) The UI responds instantly to many actions and quickly to others<br/>
b) Very few context switches (where the whole page changes and your eyes have to rescan)<br/>
c) You need fewer clicks to do the everyday tasks<br/>
d) Cleaner look (including more â€œwhite spaceï¿½?) so your eyes can relax and find stuff faster</p>, <p>2. Read mail without leaving your inbox using the Reading pane<br/>
The Reading pane allows you to read your mail without leaving your inbox. If you like the reading pane in Outlook now you have it in web mail. Other web mail services forces you to open each message and close it before reading the next message. If you have 10 messages to read, they will require 20 clicks, Kahuna: 10. (Howâ€™s that for your carpal tunnel?)</p>, <p>Want to see a wide email? Just double click the message and voila!</p>, <p>Weâ€™re looking forward to testing this out ourselves.</p>]"

Microsoft Announces Hosted Exchange and Sharepoint Deals,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/microsoft""><img class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/10926v1-max-250x250.png""/></a></p>, <p>This morning during the keynote at the <a href=""https://partner.microsoft.com/US/trainingevents/wwpartnerconference"">Microsoft Partner Conference</a> in Houston, Texas, head of the business division Stephen Elop announced a new program and suite of hosted online services. The new service offerings include hosted Exchange, Sharepoint, Communication Server and Dynamics CRM – all hosted by Microsoft as part of the new online services platform. The new offerings compete directly with existing partners that offer hosted exchange and sharepoint, as well as the free offerings from Google and others.</p>, <p>The simple ‘deskless suite’ plan starts at $3 per user per month, and includes web-based access to an Exchange mailbox through Outlook Web Access Lite along with read-only Sharepoint access. At the full service plan, which starts at $15 per month – consists of full featured hosted versions of Exchange, Sharepoint, Communication Server, live meeting and more. The capabilities of the standard service plan at $15 per user per month are similar to those of the standard editions of each of these applications.</p>, <p>The full service suite thus costs $180 per user per annum, and includes a gigayte of storage which can be expanded at a cost of 35 cents per gigabye per month. The different components that make up the suite can be added and removed, so for instance without the communication server it is $3.50 per user per month cheaper – and pricing can be further customized on an implementation basis.</p>, <p>Microsoft offering hosted services competes directly with some of their largest partners and revenue providers – so the partner conference was used as the venue to also announce the affiliate and partner program as part of the online platform. Partners who refer customers to the online services platform will earn a 12% commission on the first year of revenues, and from then on a 6% commission on all revenues from that customer. At 12% of $180 per year, it is more than a partner earns on the resale of a standard CAL for Exchange and Sharepoint, so the hope that with a solid revenue sharing model partners will drive growth in adoption of the new online model.</p>, <p>There have already been a number of large-scale customers who have switched over from either competing products, or from old self-hosted Exchange onto the new hosted platform. Companies already running large-scale instances on Microsoft Online include Nokia (who migrated from Notes), Coca Cola, Blockbuster, Energizer and many more. Microsoft have been pushing the online hosted platform and a large number of their larger integration partners are also already working with moving their customers onto the platform as part of the new partner model.</p>, <p>The partner model for the online services platform seems just as, if not more, appealing than existing partnership agreements with software licensing. With an easy-to-use admin interface, and direct integration between hosted active directory and local active directory, rolling out and migrating to the hosted platform is easy. Organizations are able to take single divisions or departments, or just a few mailboxes, and try moving them to the online platform without having to conduct a large-scale migration.</p>, <p>With online services Microsoft are looking to put a stop to the leak of companies heading towards the <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/google"">Google App</a> solution suite. Exchange and Sharepoint are products that operate at a whole different level to the Google online tools, and Microsoft are hoping that a combination of their reputation in the space, their existing market penetration and an easy to use online suite will see them prevail in the market as it shifts to becoming hosted and online.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""shot"" height=""315"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/msft-screen.jpg"" title=""msft-screen"" width=""560""/></p>]"

Some are bad – in fact, it’s disappointing to see so many applications launched just for the sake of launching -, but sometimes (just sometimes) you can actually feel when a project is set to solve a problem, even if for a small group of people.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.vitalsource.com/"">VitalSource</a> was announced yesterday, and I must admit I’ve been thinking about what its impact might be. Since you’re probably wondering by now, VitalSource is a web-application with the iTunes-twist. It consists of a client-side application (currently available for your Mac or Windows machine) that allows you to “buy books as you buy your music”.</p>, <p>A quote from their <a href=""http://www.vitalsource.com/index/news-app/story.27"">press release</a> explains it best:</p>, <p>Now students can buy their books like they buy their music – by downloading them off the Internet. The Store offers more than 1,000 titles in the VitalBook(TM) digital format, starting from as low as $.99 to 60 percent off list price of hardcopy versions. The growing inventory of VitalBooks includes classics such as Shakespeare, reference materials, and textbooks in subjects ranging from law to philosophy to medicine.</p>, <p>VitalSource sure sounds promising. This wouldn’t be an article by <a href=""http://webreakstuff.com"">me</a> if it didn’t have an ammount of constructive criticism and question asking, though. There’s a few issues that come to my mind about this application:</p>, <p>1) If they are targetting students, why not support an operating system that students seem to be using more and more? You know, Linux. I can imagine some people climbing up their chairs screaming “market share! market share!”, but this is a matter of accomodating a lot of people from one of the major target markets – students (and very importantly I imagine, IT students).</p>, <p>2) I’m always sceptical when I see a new proprietary format for any kind of information, particularly now that the web is all about reusing content and taking advantage of open formats. Naturally, VitalBook is proprietary because (and I’m assuming here, people) of piracy issues, and in order to provide <acronym>DRM</acronym>. But that raises some questions about the use of a Book bought in VS outside of VS itself. Will it <em>have</em> a use? Will it be possible to read? People are starting to read on their computers, I agree, but is the market share worth it?</p>, <p>Despite these two questions – that are no more than eye-openers – I believe VitalSource does solve a problem for some people, particularly people who either can’t afford hardcopy books, or won’t need to keep a book all the time for reference. The idea of buying books at the kind of prices they’re announcing is, undoubtedly, exciting. There’s huge competition in this field, though (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com"">Amazon</a> and <a href=""http://safari.oreilly.com/"">O’Reillys Safari Bookshelf</a>), and it sure will be interesting to see how the market accomodates this new solution.</p>, <p>More information about <a href=""http://www.vitalsource.com"">VitalSource</a> is available on their page.</p>]"
Profile – Goowy,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.goowy.com"">Goowy</a> has rebuilt a number of commonly used applicatons (like email) in Flash.

For more detail, see <a href=""http://www.flashinsider.com/2005/08/09/goowy-appears-to-be-first-flash-8-ria/"">Mike Schleifstein</a>‘s post on Goowy, although I disagree with some of the conclusions in this post – Ajax, xforms and other technologies are gunning for some of these same applications right now.</p>, <p>Flash-heavy sites are, however, currently quite trendy, and Goowy seems to be one of the best implementations. While flash can be heavy work for some simple stuff, Macromedia’s current efforts with Flex (as Mark Birbeck tells me) will make Flash a lot easier by using a high-level language on the server.</p>, <p>Once you’ve registered for the service, a virtual desktop appears that allows you to access the various applications.

They have supported us in both marketing and development.  We have been mentioned in several Macromedia press releases including the most recent Studio 8 release.  In addition we have been their site of the day several times (most recently on Aug 9th).  In addition we are working with them on more awareness / marketing initiatives in the near future which are very exciting.</p>, <p>Alex also wrote to me about upcoming features:</p>, <p>We have some very exciting functionality in our development lab right now.  In the next 30 days we are releasing an advanced calendar and some other “fun” features.  In addition we have virtual desktop storage, wireless integration, video streaming, widgets, open APIs, and more in development.

Event – Bar Camp (Day 1),"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Today I drove over 300 miles (Los Angeles to Palo Alto) to get to <a href=""http://barcamp.org/"">Bar Camp</a>. I believe that was the farthest distance anyone traveled, although I haven’t fact-checked that yet. In fact, I haven’t fact checked anything below, so if there are errors please email me or leave a comment and I’ll fix it.</p>, <p>It was worth the drive.</p>, <p>The event started at 7:00. Everyone had to “sign in” and “take a picture” which consisted of writing your name in a marker pen on a long scrolling paper and drawing your own avatar. People loved it – and there were a <a href=""http://barcamp.org/index.cgi?BarCampers"">lot of people</a> (minus a <a href=""http://archive.scripting.com/2005/08/20#When:1:04:57AM"">few stragglers</a> who never made it out of the cafe :-)). There was a working “wiki” literally written up on a whiteboard (real <a href=""http://barcamp.org/"">wiki</a> here) and people were free to add discussion topics to the agenda for either of the two meeting rooms.</p>, <p>Pizza was delivered. There was a referigerator full of beer (less full later in the evening). And there was wide open wifi. Paradise.</p>, <p>My notes for the day are below. This is by no means a transcript of what happened (there was just too much). But it is my views and opinions on the stuff I was able to participate in.</p>, <p>After introductions (led by <a href=""http://an9.org/blog/"">Andy Smith</a> and <a href=""http://factoryjoe.com/blog/"">Chris Messina</a> from Flock), <a href=""http://"">Ross Mayfield</a> led a discussion about how to (quickly, easily, informally) create a communication and feedback mechanism for attendees (including those not physically present). Lots of good ideas, mostly centered around the wiki since it’s up and running.</p>, <p>By the way, if you haven’t read it yet, check out Chris’ post on <a href=""http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2005/08/18/bar-camp-buzz-builds-the-story-twists-turns-shouts/"">how Bar Camp was created</a>.</p>, <p>Ross also spoke about a new product that Social Text has soft-launched, called <a href=""http://www.wikiwyg.net/"">WikiWyg</a>. It deserves its own profile (and will get one if I can corner Ross long enough to talk about it a bit more), but it is basically a tool to allow people to edit wiki’s without using wiki code. Try out the <a href=""http://demo.wikiwyg.net/wikiwyg/demo/"">demo</a> – you can double click on any text on the page and toggle between a wysiwyg editor, a wikitext editor, and preview. If they add authorization functionality, this would be one great way to edit your own blog, as well.</p>, <p>Mike Prince, the founder of <a href=""http://www.mobido.com"">Mobido</a>, gave a brief demo of his company. There wasn’t enough time for me to fully understand Mobido, but it is a network for sharing photos and short content (names, contact info, etc.) around an event. One use of this is for everyone at an event to take a picture of themselves and post in on a Mobido event page, along with their name, etc., and people can see everyone who attended and know who they are. There are RSS capabilities as well. This is another company I’d like to profile.</p>, <p>I walked in to this session a bit late. The official title was “blogging for Profit” and was led by <a href=""http://niallkennedy.com/blog/"">Niall Kennedy</a> (Technorati). The discussion evolved into a general discussion of “what is blogging”  and “why do people blog” over time.</p>, <p><a href=""http://blog.softtechvc.com/"">Jeff Clavier</a> made an interesting comment in response to a question. Jeff, who is a VC, said he blogs because it helps him network with companies and gives him leads. I agree that few VCs are blogging, and most that do blog mostly about being a VC (<a href=""http://www.ventureblog.com/"">with</a> <a href=""http://avc.blogs.com/"">notable</a> <a href=""http://willprice.blogspot.com/"">exceptions</a> of course). You can tell from Jeff’s blog that he is more than open to getting communications from new companies, and it has served him very, very well.</p>, <p>I also think blogging, if you do it intensely, gives you excellent insight into developing trends way before everyone else sees them. You get this partly from reading blogs, and partly from comments and email from people talking about what they are doing. Interaction, lead generation and early intelligence is (mostly) why I love writing for TechCrunch so much. As a related aside, I hear that a <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=107"">company</a> I profiled a month ago may be getting some more mainstream press in the near future. :-)</p>, <p>The session ended with <a href=""http://dorrianporter.typepad.com/"">Dorrian Porter</a> (click…subscribed to feed) suggesting that the group consider attempting to categorize blogs by intent or subject matter. A big task in my opinion.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/ioerror/"">Jacob Appelbaum</a> gave a presentation of his “motorcycle” project – a sniffer of content on wifi networks. He proved the power of his application by reading out random passwords of people in the audience (who where blogging, checking email, etc., while listening). The occasional “Crap! that’s mine” and “please shut this off” was heard. I simply shut down my computer.</p>, <p>He talked about how easy it is to “own someone” by monitoring their traffic. Because people tend to recycle passwords, he said, once you have one password you likely have access to their entire life. Scary stuff.</p>, <p>Jacob also noted that many new web 2.0 companies, like flickr, are not hashing passwords as they are sent over the net, meaning they can easily be sniffed by anyone monitoring the local network.</p>, <p>He’s launching motorcyle as an open source project “for people to use and enjoy.”</p>, <p>By the way, Jiwire has a product called <a href=""http://www.jiwire.com/spotlock.htm"">Spotlock</a> that will encrypt your traffic and help you avoid this type of thing. $5 a month, free to try. I’ll be installing it before tomorrow morning.</p>, <p>I met a number of interesting people tonight and subscribed to their blogs. I’m sure there will be lots more over the weekend.</p>, <p><a href=""http://an9.org/blog/"">Andy Smith</a><br/>

Profile – Skylook (for Skype),"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Outlook is cool. Skype is cool. Get a couple of Australians to bang them together and what do you get? <a href=""http://www.skylook.biz"">Skylook</a>. It skypefies Outlook and it’s awesome.</p>, <p>Skype does already have a product for Outlook, which we <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=70"">profiled last month</a>. Skylook is much more advanced and easy to use (although, unlike Skype’s Outlook Toolbar, it is not free).</p>, <p>The download is about 2.2 mb. You can try it out for free with a 14 day trial. $29.95 after that to purchase.</p>, <p>After installation, there are three main feature areas that I like.</p>, <p>The first feature I like is auto-recording of all skype calls and IM chats. After recording, Skylook places the file in a special folder and they can be forwarded via email, searched, etc.</p>, <p>The second feature I like is that you have presence information for skype contacts directly within Outlook, and you can start IMs and voice calls directly from Outlook.</p>, <p>The third feature I like is the ability to “one click” call contacts via either skype or skype out, directly from their vcard.</p>, <p>Skylook’s CEO, Jeremy Hague, wrote to me and included the following information:</p>, <p><strong>What differentiates Skylook from the Skype Outlook toolbar?</strong></p>, <p>Skylook is much more than an Outlook toolbar for Skype.  Skylook does for Voice and IM what Outlook does for email.  Skylook allows you to store and later retrieve all of your Skype communications, in exactly the same way you store and retrieve emails today.</p>, <p>Outlook is a great tool for managing email.  It lets you store, organize, sort and search in many different ways.  Wouldnâ€™t it be great if you could use all those great Outlook features not just on email, but on all of your communications?  Skylook lets you do just that.</p>, <p>Skylook records all voice calls as items in a special Outlook folder.  Each item includes details such as who you called, the duration of the call etc., but best of all the actual conversation is recorded as a high quality MP3 file and included as an attachment to the item.  Because this is saved as a standard Outlook item, just like an email, you can file it for later reference in exactly the same way as you do with email.</p>, <p>Skylook also records all text chats as items in Outlook.  Each item includes details such as who took part in the chat etc.  Because this is saved as a standard Outlook item, you can file it for later reference.  Later on, you can search on it, sort it, archive it or use any of those great Outlook features that normally only work with email.</p>, <p>To remove the need for you to constantly switch back and forth between Outlook and Skype, Skylook has a presence button in the Outlook toolbar for each Skype contact who is currently on-line.  This button shows the status of the contact (e.g. on-line, away etc.) with a handy icon, and also allows easy access to contact details and recent emails and Skype conversation recordings.</p>, <p>In addition to the above, Skylook provides all the features you would expect from a Skype toolbar for Outlook.  You can call an Outlook contact using Skype, start a text chat with an Outlook contact, select an email and immediately start a voice or text chat with one of the recipients, select an appointment and immediately start a voice or text chat with one of the recipients, and more.</p>, <p>Skylook is a keeper for us. And not just because Jeremy gave me a free activation key. :-) I’d pay for this.</p>, <p>Jeremy Hague<br/>

<strong>Location:</strong> Oakland, CA</p>, <p id=""speakable-summary"">Do you love music? Are you the kind of person who’s pissed off because your iPod only holds 60 gigs? If you are, stop reading this, click over to <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/pandora"">Pandora</a> and request an invitation to their private alpha <em>right now</em>. Then come back and read the rest of this post.</p>, <p>If you don’t agree that this is the coolest application you’ve seen in a long while, re-read this post over and over until you agree, because you are wrong. I am in love with Pandora. It’s like the Internet was invented so that Pandora could be.</p>, <p>I met with <a href=""http://tomconrad.blogspot.com/2005/08/bar-camp.html"">Tom Conrad</a>, Pandora’s CTO, today at <a href=""http://barcamp.org/"">Bar Camp</a> and he gave me a private demonstration. He’s presenting to the group today at 5 pm as well.</p>, <p>What is it? It is a music recommendation engine and player and it is the future of discovering the long tail of music.</p>, <p>Pandora is a technology based solution. They spend about 20 minutes analyzing the identity of a song (“everything from melody, harmony and rhythm, to instrumentation, orchestration, arrangement, lyrics, and of course the rich world of singing and vocal harmony”) – and they’ve analyzed 300,000 of them (10,000 artists) over the last five years. See Pandora’s <a href=""http://www.pandora.com/radio/mgp.do"">Music Genome Project</a> – a five year project involved scores of musicians to analyze music:</p>, <p>On January 6, 2000 a group of musicians and music-loving technologists came together with the idea of creating the most comprehensive analysis of music ever.</p>, <p>Together we set out to capture the essence of music at the most fundamental level. We ended up assembling literally hundreds of musical attributes or “genes” into a very large Music Genome. Taken together these genes capture the unique and magical musical identity of a song – everything from melody, harmony and rhythm, to instrumentation, orchestration, arrangement, lyrics, and of course the rich world of singing and vocal harmony. It’s not about what a band looks like, or what genre they supposedly belong to, or about who buys their records – it’s about what each individual song sounds like.</p>, <p>Over the past 5 years, we’ve carefully listened to the songs of over 10,000 different artists – ranging from popular to obscure – and analyzed the musical qualities of each song one attribute at a time. This work continues each and every day as we endeavor to include all the great new stuff coming out of studios, clubs and garages around the world.</p>, <p>And…it works!</p>, <p><img class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/pandora1.png"" style=""float:left;""/>Once you’ve registered, you simply create a “channel” by typing in an artist or song name. It may ask for clarification if it has multiple matches, then it will start streaming the song (or one of the artist’s songs if you’ve chosen an artist) at 128k (great quality). Here’s the good part. Click on a button and you can find similar music by other artists. I created a Nirvana category. Soon Pandora was playing “The Man Who Sold the World” (a great song”). By clicking forward, Pandora then played “Wings of the Throne” by Guided by Places, “How’s it Going to Be” by Third Eye Blind, and then “Nutshell” by Alice in Chains. Perfect.</p>, <p>Click on any song and buy it on iTunes or Amazon.</p>, <p><strike>Here’s a secret way to get an instant invite into Pandora (I think you deserve it for reading this deep into the post). Pandora allows you to share your channels (and even has a most popular list). Click on my <a href=""http://www.pandora.com/?pre=902017467f2629eb4c025af8518c9d2111f77debf9b6deaf4a859037e86618aa53be7d847d3d4171&amp;ss=12601"">Nirvana Channel</a> and you will be prompted to sign up, <u>bypassing the invitation requirement</u>.</strike>Correction. If you would like an invitation to Pandora, please email me at editor@beta.techcrunch.com and I will send one to you.

I’m done with invites. You’re on your own.</p>, <p>One last tidbit that Tom shared with me – Apparently, sometimes people like certain kinds of music that they think is pretty darn fringe/indie/hard core. And sometimes, when they look at related music after Pandora has put it through an objective technical analysis, they see stuff by britney spears/hilary duff/[insertcraphere]. Pandora isn’t broken. The listener is. :-)</p>, <p>I am going to be posting a ton more on this over time.</p>, <p>10 hours free for every new user<br/>
$3 per month after that</p>, <p><em>Update:</em> <a href=""http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/08/20.html#a10922"">Scoble loves this too</a>:</p>, <p>Tom sent me an email explaining what it does: “Pandora is a “music discovery service” designed to help you find and enjoy music that you’ll love. It works like this: you give us the name of an artist or song and we instantly create a “station” that plays songs that share musical characteristics with the artist/song you entered. From there you can fine-tune the station to your tastes by giving us feedback on the individual tracks we play. You can make up to 100 unique stations that play all kinds of music – Pop, Rock, Jazz, Electronica, Hip Hop, old, new, big names, and small acts — over 300,000 songs from more than 10,000 artists. Pandora is entirely web-based; you won’t need to install any software to start listening.”</p>]"
Dave Winer's Purple Cow – the OPML Editor,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">Dave Winer has been working on outlining software for over 20 years. Check out his <a href=""http://www.opml.org/"">OPML Editor</a> (OPML stands for Outline Processor Markup Language) that has recently come out of private beta – people are using it for everything from writing and updating simple to-do lists to creating and editing blogs. It’s extremely versatile and it’s open source.</p>, <p>OPML an XML-based format that allows exchange of outline-structured information between applications running on different operating systems and environments. <a href=""http://www.opml.org/about"">Link</a></p>, <p>Since people are writing exhaustively about the product and the technology (and using it for <a href=""http://archive.scripting.com/search/default?q=opml+editor"">incredibly creative things</a>), I want to talk about it from a different angle.</p>, <p>For those of you familiar with <a href=""http://sethgodin.typepad.com"">Seth Godin</a>, you’ll know what a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/159184021X/permissionmarket/002-1922935-6175214"">Purple Cow</a> is. The basic idea of the purple cow is that for products to be noticed in today’s world of fragmented attention and product saturation, it has to be something really special. You don’t notice cows any more no matter how cool they are (because they are basically all the same), but you sure would notice a big purple cow munching on some grass in a field somewhere.</p>, <p>Dave has in my opinion masterfully crafted a purple cow with his OPML Editor. I’ve been witnessing its development and launch for a while now, and I’m impressed.</p>, <p>The first time I saw the software in action was earlier this year in New York (Dave gave me a demo). The second time I saw it was just before the <a href=""http://gnomedex.jot.com/WikiHome"">Gnomedex conference</a> this year in Seattle.  That’s about the time that Dave put his marketing efforts into high gear.</p>, <p>After the sofware was (mostly) baked, Dave invited a small group of trusted friends to bang on it. Because this was such a select group, the people involved really felt special (and they were). They went out of their way to provide good feedback. He took their input and made changes. Then he increased the size of the group to 20 or so (I was in this group). At Gnomedex, he increased the size further. All the while, Dave was getting free QA and product work, and these people were blogging about how awesome and powerful it was.</p>, <p>Lots of people read the blogs of the testers, and want to know more. Heck, I begged him to be on the invite list.</p>, <p>On June 23, 2005, Dave <a href=""http://archive.scripting.com/2005/06/23#When:10:04:22PM"">announced</a> that he would start using the OPML editor to edit Scripting News, his blog:</p>, <p>I’m sure this doesn’t mean a lot to most people, but I’m now using the OPML Editor to create and edit Scripting News. In the business, we call this Eating The Dogfood, which is actually kind of a gross image (you have to see your users as dogs, which may not be very healthy). Anyway using the product yourself helps reinforce its reality, to me.</p>, <p>Even more people learn about the software and understand that it can be used for things like writing and editing blogs, and want to know more.</p>, <p>Dave, who travels quite a bit anyway, started to hold OPML Editor road shows around the country. I believe the first one was in <a href=""http://archive.scripting.com/2005/07/01#When:2:42:41PM"">New York on July 12</a>, and he’s been in many cities since.</p>, <p>Tonight, he had a road show in <a href=""http://geeks.opml.org/2005/07/18#a149"">Berkeley</a>, and 100+ people <a href=""http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/08/20.html#a10927"">packed into the audience</a> to see the Editor in action. I was there, and people were interested, inquisitive and downright <em>passionate </em>about it.</p>, <p>More users check it out. It’s available now, so people are starting to use it for unexpected things, and it grows virally.</p>, <p>Dave is not a professional marketer, but he’s one of the best marketers I’ve seen. He’s spent exactly nothing in marketing dollars to promote the product (unless you count gas money),  and yet he’s created a whole group of influential users (mostly bloggers who sneeze about the product) who feel special because they were part of the closed testing group. Not to mention hundreds more who’ve attended his road shows because Dave made the effort to come to them, show them the product and patiently answer the same questions over and over in different cities.</p>, <p>And yes, Dave is also eating his own dog food by using his product to write one of the most popular blogs on the internet (<a href=""http://www.technorati.com/pop/blogs/"">#22 tonight</a> out of 14 million or so total blogs).</p>, <p>I’m impressed.</p>]"

Its fast, its easy, its free and it can be automated. So blogs are coming at us left and right. We are killing off thousands a day, but they keep on coming. Like Zombies. Its straight from Night of the Living Dead. Brain dead splogs. Coming at us by the thousands.</p>, <p>Blogger is by far the worst offender. Google seems to be working hard to adjust their relevancy indexes to exclude splog from having influence on search rankings, but they dont seem to be doing anything more than removing reported splogs.

The Personal Bee – A Better Way to Read News,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">There’s something I’ve been griping about for a long time (most recently to <a href=""http://www.econometa.com"">Adam Marsh</a> on the first evening of  <a href=""http://www.barcamp.org/"">Bar Camp</a>): I read hundreds of feeds every day (320 as of today), and it takes frickin forever to go through it all. <u>There is a better way to find good content</u> in a massive number of posts from hundreds of feeds than clicking on each feed and screening it yourself. And I know what it is.</p>, <p>My idea? Automate the process, and return the results visually. A <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=68"">Tag Cloud</a> is a perfect way to do this. Imagine if all of your unread feeds were scanned, keywords and/or tags were analyzed, and a tag cloud was created where you could see words with font size and boldness determined by how prominent they were in the posts. That way, you could just click on what you want to read, and ignore the fluff.</p>, <p>This appears to be what <a href=""http://www.personalbee.com"">The Personal Bee</a> (note: this site is down quite often)  is experimenting with. Created by <a href=""http://www.mdv.com/team_chim.htm"">Nicholas Chim</a> as a side project from his day job, Personal Bee has this to say about itself:</p>, <p>The Personal Bee is a “discovery engine” that helps you discover information from a collection of RSS feeds. In contrast, client-based RSS readers and web-based RSS aggregators merely catalog your RSS feeds. These tools are adequate if you subscribe to fewer than 5-10 news sources per topic of interest. Compared to RSS search engines, the Bee captures the latest “buzz words” in a topic area without requiring you to pre-specify search terms.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Adam Marsh tells me that Nicholas presented at Bar Camp, although I was not present at the session (thanks for passing this on Adam). I wish I was there. Personal Bee has a number of public feeds (see <a href=""http://www.personalbee.com/reader.php?grpno=227"">Web 2.0</a> for instance), and you can also register and create your own private or public feeds.</p>, <p>As you can see from the screenshot, a tag cloud is placed prominently in the left sidebar. Things like “Feedster 500” and “Pandora” are big – things I want to click on right away. When I do click on a word in the tag cloud, the relevant content is pulled.</p>, <p>Bloglines, Pluck, Rojo, Attensa, NewsGator, and others: Please note this application, and listen to your power users. There is a better way to show new data, and it is so easy to implement.</p>, <p>I’ll be playing around with this application a lot in the near future.</p>]"
Measure Map is Coming,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>I just heard a very juicy rumor (some <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/search/%22measure%20map%22"">stuff</a> already on Technorati about this) that Adaptive Path is coming out with a very cool new Ajax application called <a href=""http://www.measuremap.com/"">Measure Map</a>. The site is taking registration requests now.</p>, <p>People who are participating in the alpha are drooling. It’s apparently a blog analytics tool that crushes everything else out there.

Hula – (possibly) a New Ajax Calendar,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>We just heard about a new online calendar application called Hula that’s ajax-based.

The power of Ajax to make web apps work like desktop apps is awesome.</p>, <p>I just hope it’s cheaper than <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=24"">Trumba</a>, which is charging $40/year.</p>, <p><em>Update:</em> Thanks to Ross in the comments area, we now have a link to <a href=""http://www.hula-project.org/Hula_Server"">Hula</a>. “Hula is a calendar and mail server whose goal is to be fun and easy to use, while scaling effortlessly from small groups to large organizations with thousands of members.

"Google Talk Live, Functional","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>There’s been blog chatter all day about <a href=""http://www.google.com/talk/"">Google Talk</a>. I didn’t write about it because I couldn’t use it (it hadn’t launched yet) and I certainly wasn’t “breaking” the story.</p>, <p>Not only that,  it seems to me that Skype already has a quite nice and functional application to do this type of thing. <u>And the fact that Google Talk had a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Talk"">wikipedia</a> page up even before it launched</u> made me sort of think things had gotten a little out of hand.</p>, <p>But I couldn’t resist, of course. The second the client was available for download I jumped to the site and took the plunge.</p>, <p>Google Talk works and it looks and sounds cool. It’s now the 15th IM client on my desktop – MSN, meetro, Yahoo, Skype, Gizmo, AIM, …</p>, <p>You don’t have to download Google’s software to use the service. You can use any Jabber/XMPP <a href=""http://www.google.com/talk/otherclients.html"">client</a>. <a href=""http://news.com.com/Google+unveils+instant-messaging+entry/2100-1032_3-5842254.html?tag=nefd.top"">Cnet</a> puts it well:</p>, <p>One advantage to Google Talk could be its ability to connect with users of competing services. Google Talk is based on the Jabber open-source standard, which allows consumers to connect with other messaging systems that work with Jabber, such as Apple Computer’s iChat, GAIM, Adium, Trillian Pro and Psi.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Google Talk has a nice interface, works quickly and is generally a great product.</p>, <p>Here’s the key features:</p>, <p>Here’s what it lacks:</p>, <p>So try it out and feel free to add us (techcrunch is our username).</p>, <p>Keith Teare, my partner at Archimedes Ventures, is thinking that Google is very obviously dripping out features and products that Microsoft is including in Vista. He wrote to me, using Google Talk:</p>, <p>keith.teare: “It’s almost as if Google is implementing the features Microsoft has announced for Longhorn – Sidebar; voice calls inside IM, RSS integration – but doing it ahead of Microsoft, by about 12 months.</p>, <p>A Google layer between Users and the OS.</p>, <p>Rendering the OS a commodity</p>, <p>It reminds me of a <a href=""http://weblog.teare.com/?p=116"">post I did </a>on my weblog about 18 months ago”</p>, <p>I agree with Keith 100% on this one (a first).</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.downloadsquad.com/2005/08/23/googe-talk-review/"">DownloadSquad</a> (very nice review), <a href=""http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives/2005/08/google_to_start.html"">Dwight Silverman</a>, <a href=""http://techlifeblogged.blogspot.com/2005/08/more-interesting-stuff-from-google.html"">Scott Kingery</a>, <a href=""http://blogs.siliconvalley.com/gmsv/2005/08/we_really_dont_.html"">GMSV</a>, <a href=""http://business2.blogs.com/business2blog/2005/08/google_talk.html"">Erick Schonfeld</a>, <a href=""http://benbarren.blogspot.com/2005/08/everyones-googletalking.html"">Ben Barren</a> (I love this blog – guess why), <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2005/08/23/googles-jabber-is-alive/"">Om Malik</a></p>]"
"Sun To Shed Up To 2,500 Jobs In Strategic Move","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""shot"" src=""http://www.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0001/6586/16586v2-max-250x250.png"" style=""float:left;""/></p>, <p>It has <a href=""http://www.broomfieldenterprise.com/news/2008/jul/10/sun-cuts-1000-jobs-us-and-canada/"">been reported</a> that 1,000 employees are going to be losing their jobs at Sun, with layoffs potentially reaching up to 2,500 employees. The losses are mostly within marketing and sales, and affect the main headquarters as well as the Menlo Park Campus and employees in Colorado. Sun stock is down 6% today to end the week at $9.11, down 64% on its 52-week high of $25.04.</p>, <p>Jonathan Schwartz took over as CEO from Scott McNealy in April of 2004, and has instituted a new philosophy and has attempted to rejuvenate the company. We listened to him speak recently at the <a href=""http://www.supernova2008.com/"">Supernova conference</a>, and the concensus amongst those in the audience was that Jonathan had, for the first time as CEO, delivered a concise and clear description of the new strategy at Sun.</p>, <p>His talk was about how Sun leverages open source by allowing its software (such as MySQL and ZFS) to float out and be downloaded for free, from where a small percentage of those users can be converted to customers. So through open source and free, Sun have the benefit of a free lead generation and marketing machine – especially with MySQL which is currently being downloaded over 70,000 times a day. At one point, Schwartz had a map of the world with a highlighted dot for each place where a copy of <a href=""http://mysql.com"">MySQL </a>or ZFS had been downloaded – and it covered almost the whole world (including islands in the Pacific and Indian oceans). Schwartz pointed out that even though there were users of Sun products in those areas, it was accomplished without requiring Sun sales or Sun marketing in those countries or cities.</p>, <p>With reports that up to 2,500 positions will be made redundant at Sun, with up to 60-70% of marketing and sales to go, Schwartz is definitely practicing what he preaches and is doing away with expensive and traditional enterprise sales and marketing. Instead, he is substituting it with a strategy based on acquiring customers through open source and free.</p>]"
Building The Microsoft Mesh,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" class=""shot"" height=""165"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/mesh-logo.jpg"" title=""mesh-logo"" width=""260""/></p>, <p><a href=""http://microsoft.com"">Microsoft</a> has dominated the desktop market with Windows since the very first PC’s – a solid run of almost three decades. Despite a late start and some tactics that lead to a lengthy DOJ trial, Microsoft also has the majority of market share in the browser market with Internet Explorer. With the advent of smartphones, <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/microsoft"">Microsoft</a> released Windows Mobile and through device manufacturers such as <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/htc"">HTC</a> has managed to gain a foothold in the mobile handset market.</p>, <p>These three markets, along with servers, have formed the pillars of Microsoft upon which one of the worlds most profitable companies has been built. In technology applications come and go but the platforms tend to stick – so there is a very methodical process currently taking place within companies such as <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/adobe"">Adobe</a>, <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/google"">Google</a>, <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/apple"">Apple</a> etc. to build the next new web platform. That next new platform will supplant operating systems, browsers and all else and present a uniform interface across devices and systems to both developers and users.</p>, <p>That new platform at Microsoft is called <a href=""http://www.mesh.com"">The Mesh</a>, a standards-based P2P network for communication between devices, applications and identities. The network is built around making each node both a client and a server, and running web services between them. The web services are simple, RSS and the Atom Publishing Protocol, with the foundations based on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FeedSync"">Feedsync</a>, a protocol Ray Ozzie initially developed that added list extensions to RSS. Feeds of feeds are represented in RSS and a protocol similar to OPML, and there is auto-discovery built in, RESTful URL schemas for addressing users, objects and properties and a services discovery protocol.</p>, <p>The client in Mesh is a local proxy, which synchs and establishes all communication back to the server or to other peers. All local applications are built to point to localhost, the application itself doesn’t need to know where or how it is running, The Mesh takes care of that. Applications can be moved from web to desktop while a user’s settings and profile remain the same. You can click ‘open’ in a web application and see your files from all your different PC’s and devices. You can login at a machine anywhere and have all your data and your profile available to you – and you can push that profile into any application or network that supports the same standard protocols.</p>, <p>What we are talking about with The Mesh is the platform, not the application that many are logging into today to try out. There is a clear distinction here – what you see with file synching and adding machines are implementations of applications on the The Mesh network. The Mesh is a lot bigger than file synching – it’s about detaching users, files and applications from both hardware and operating systems. It is about having all users, files and applications being able to inter-communicate and inter-operate.</p>, <p>The open standards and source communities have been developing and discussing similar schemes in the past few years, involving data portability, feed standards and identity standards. The difference with Mesh is that Microsoft has raced ahead and <strong>actually built it all</strong>. This is an original vision that began in Microsoft with the arrival of <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ray-ozzie"">Ray Ozzie</a>, and while there are naysayers within Microsoft itself, the open standards and web communities should at least recognize what is being built here and more importantly – how it is being built.</p>, <p><b>Update</b> Must-see video demo of development on Mesh</p>, <p><a href=""http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Dan/399153/player/"">http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Dan/399153/player/</a><br/> <a href=""http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Dan/Ori-Amiga-Programming-the-Mesh/"">Ori Amiga: Programming the Mesh</a></p>]"

I’d much rather use this time either testing Kahuna (and most likely writing amazing things about it), or testing something else (there are lots of other profiles on my to-do list).</p>, <p>So, do you guys agree and consider it kind of lame to waste our time like this? Or am I wrong and this treasure hunt is an example of hip, cool, edgey and/or extreme marketing (marketing 2.0)?</p>, <p>I am now done with this particular gripe.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Back to Kahuna, Imran has posted additional screen shots and information on the service. He had a <a href=""http://spaces.msn.com/members/mailcall/"">previous post</a> where he stated 2 of his top 5 reasons for liking Kahuna.</p>, <p>Today he <a href=""http://spaces.msn.com/members/mailcall/Blog/cns!1pFgRKa8Lr6GIMM5UtTma4pQ!417.entry"">posted reasons 3 and 4</a> (leaving us in suspense for #5), along with a new screen shot of Kahuna (see to left):</p>, <p><strong>3. Keyboard shortcuts to read mail</strong><br/>
Iâ€™m sure the power users will love this.  Use â€œ[â€œ and â€œ]” to navigate the message list and read your messages without using the mouse at all.  Combine these with the preview pane and the delete key shortcut to delete messages and you can cruise through your inbox in no time flat.  To read a message, click Enter to open a message in a larger view and click Esc to return to your message list.  Also, “control [” and “control ]” will allow you to move between mail folders.</p>, <p><strong>4. Change message encoding as you read</strong><br/>
Do you get a lot of mails in a variety languages? If the mail itself does not specify the encoding Hotmail calculates the encoding by analyzing the message.  You can choose the correct encoding if mail beta’s automatic choice was wrong so your messages look right regardless of the sending language or encoding.</p>, <p>It really does look like Kahuna will be user friendly and fast. Looking forward to future posts on this.</p>]"
Pandora to launch next week,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/pandoralogo.png"" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/pandora"">Pandora</a>‘s founder, Tim Westergren, sent an email out to all beta testers announcing that Pandora will go live next week, and extending the free trial period for beta testers to September 28. Pandora has had an overwhelmingly positive blogger response to their beta. I assume the general launch will be well received as well.</p>, <p>Our previous profile on Pandora on August 20, 2005 is <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=167"">here</a>. The text of the email is below:</p>, <p>Hello,</p>, <p>I first want to say thanks very much for participating in our friends &amp; family preview. It has been a very exciting and gratifying few weeks for all us here at Pandora.  Since we launched the beta site last month,  we’ve seen tremendous interest in the service – one user even went so far as to call Pandora ‘the best reason for the web to exist’.  Most importantly, you’ve given us a ton of great feedback on how we can improve the service.  Thanks for all your time and effort.</p>, <p>We’re launching the site to the general public next week. Based on your feedback, this new version will include a ‘station history’ feature which allows users to see what’s played and go back and rate a song or buy it on iTunes/Amazon after it has played. We’ve also made it easier to share stations and have made some improvements to the user interface. You’ve also contributed to a long list of great ideas going forward which we can’t wait to add.</p>, <p>To thank you for participating in the preview, you will be able to use Pandora for free through September 28th. To log in, use your username, which is your email address, and password. (New users will be able to use Pandora for free for a short period, then can subscribe to the service for $36 for one year of unlimited use).</p>, <p>Thanks again for your help and encouragement!  I sincerely hope you’ll stay with us as we start this exciting new phase for the company.</p>, <p>Cheers.</p>, <p>Tim Westergren<br/>

Flock – Social Browsing is Cool,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.flock.com"">Flock</a> is a new browser, built on top of firefox. It is a functional browser with excellent features (including firefox features like tabbed browsing, etc.). What really makes is stand out are two additional features they’ve added to build social networking directly into the browsing experience: social bookmarking and a wysiwyg blog writing tool.</p>, <p>Flock was originally called <a href=""http://www.roundtwo.com/node/129"">Round Two</a> and raised money (reportedly around $1 million) from Bessemer Venture Partners. For more on the fundraising and early reports, see <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2005/05/26/round-two-nails-round-one/"">Om Malik</a> and <a href=""http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2005/05/27/round_two_scores_round_one.html"">SiliconBeat</a>.</p>, <p>We got our first look at Flock at <a href=""http://www.barcamp.org"">Bar Camp</a> last weekend – Andy Smith and Chris Messina gave a great demo. Our beta invitation came that weekend as well.</p>, <p>Flock should be launching publicly sometime in September. They have windows, mac and linux versions of their browser already.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Flock has integrated del.icio.us-type features right into the browser. When you are on a page you would like to bookmark, simply press a “+” button on the top left of the toolbar and the page is automatically included in your bookmark area (called your “breadcrumbs”). You can also tag bookmarks, of course.</p>, <p>Additional features include your “watchlist” (people who’s bookmarks you would like to monitor), and “groups” (basically, defined groups of flockers linking to this category).</p>, <p>Breadcrumbs, Watchlists and Groups all have RSS feeds (of course).</p>, <p>This is pure magic. We’ve tested most blogging tools out there, including qumana (the best in our opinion – profiled <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=145"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=18"">here</a>), blogjet (<a href=""http://blog.softtechvc.com/2005/07/weblog_posting_.html"">Jeff Clavier likes this one</a>) and others. All of these requre a download and allow offline drafting and wysiwyg functionality.</p>, <p>I have to say I think Flock blows them all away. I’m dying to show a screen shot, but Flock has asked it’s beta testers not to (so ignore the very, very small screen shot above). To show this right now would be pushing the limits of their trust, so I won’t.</p>, <p>But it rocks. Setup was very easy (I tested it with my personal blog). It has functionality for editing posts (even posts not created with Flock), quick toggle between preview and viewing the actual code, and, the best feature in my opinion, the ability to simply drag flickr photos direclty into the post and manipulate them. They also allow quick and easy technorati tagging. Wow. I mean, really, wow. This stuff is not trivial to build. The ajax funtionality is stunning.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.decrem.com/bart/bio/"">Bart Decrem</a> is Flock’s CEO and co-founder.

The Big Moo by Seth Godin,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://sethgodin.typepad.com/"">Seth Godin</a> is my favorite business writer right now.</p>, <p>In fact, as I look around, my desk is littered with copies of his books – <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/159184021X/permissionmarket/002-1922935-6175214"">Purple Cow</a> (my favorite), <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591841003/ref=pd_sxp_elt_l1/002-1922935-6175214"">All Marketers are Liars</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786887176/ref=pd_sxp_elt_l1/002-1922935-6175214"">Unleashing the Ideavirus</a>.</p>, <p>Read these books and learn about how to build and market products that will excite your customers. See <a href=""http://www.lightbox5.com/movabletype/archives/2005/03/3qs_seth_godin.html"">here</a> for a short interview with Seth by Brian Oberkirch.</p>, <p>I haven’t had the opportunity to meet Seth in person yet, but I sure hope to. I’ll probably act like a teenage girl meeting some cool pop band, and not know what to say. Maybe I’ll get a picture with him. That would be cool.</p>, <p>His books are crisply written and to the point. And his points are good. One of my favorite quotes, from Purple Cow, is:</p>, <p>If someone in your organization is charged with creating a Purple Cow, <em>leave them alone!</em> Don’t use internal reviews and usability testing to figure out if the new product is as good as what you’ve got now. Instead, pick the right maverick and get out of the way. </p>, <p>As I mentioned in a recent <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=151"">weekly summary</a> (see no. 6), Seth’s new book, <a href=""http://www.sethgodin.com/bigmoo/"">The Big Moo</a>, is coming out and he’s eating his own dogfood in promoting it. Seth has started selling batches of 50 galley copies to people if they promise to “sneeze” the book to other influential people. I purchased 50 copies, and am now offering them to TechCrunch readers.</p>, <p>By the way, the book is another winner. It’s a collaborative effort – Seth has brought in 33 “of the world’s smartest business thinkers” to write the book. I started it last night and have almost finished it. I am learning to not be boring. I am trying to be fearless. I am going to risk it all (more on this later…edgeio).</p>, <p>I am giving these books away. The first 10 comments to this post get a free copy. I’ll even pay the shipping if you are in the US or Canada. If you are somewhere else, I’ll ask for $5 in shipping.  <a href=""http://theshot92.blogspot.com/2005/08/free-moo-offer-is-full-sorry.html"">Dave Wheeler</a> did the same thing and got an overwhelming response.</p>, <p>I’ll send another batch to the first 10 people who post about the book and trackback here. Same rules apply on shipping.</p>, <p>If you comment, I already have your email address. If you trackback, make sure you send you email me at editor@beta.techcrunch.com along with the post URL. Once I have the 20 complete, I’ll send out a mass email to get your shipping address.</p>, <p>Good luck to those of you who use slow RSS readers. :-)</p>]"
Rollyo – Roll your own search engine,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><strong>Note:</strong> Due to a misunderstanding, I posted a profile of Rollyo while the company was in private beta and did not want any publicity (the misunderstanding was that I didn’t know this when I posted). They have requested that I remove the post for now, and I am complying. Nothing heavy, I just received a very polite email request from a very smart employee of the company. In my opinion, all this controversy just adds more buzz and is ultimately good for the company. And I also understand that Rollyo would like to keep things a little quiet for now as they work through the beta. I look forward to re-posting when the time is right. In the meantime, I’m going to keep testing the site. Good things are going on over there. Check it out (by requesting a beta invite).</p>]"
Group Search with Raw Sugar,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.rawsugar.com"">Raw Sugar</a> is somewhat similar to <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=182"">Rollyo</a>, which we profiled yesterday. Raw Sugar basically combines del.icio.us type social bookmarking, with search (of your and other’s bookmarks, along with google results).</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>You can save a URI found in Raw Sugar Search results, or use a bookmarklet to save any browsed page (support at this time for firefox and explorer only). You can also add a description and tags. Your tags are saved on your user page with a unique URI. This page is also customizable with images, pictures, etc.</p>, <p>For instance, taking someone at random, here is <a href=""http://www.rawsugar.com/collections/frank"">Frank</a>, who is apparently just about to complete a world class bellyflop and likes, among other things, kung fu (if his tags are indicative of his interests). He also likes the Ramones, which is one of my favorite bands (reminds me that I need to create a Ramones station on <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=167"">Pandora</a>).</p>, <p>Raw Sugar offers a nice search service that leverages tagged pages and presents them in search results  (keyword and tagged based results look to be mixed, which seems right). They also have a “refine” option after your first search, which further narrows the results set (something <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=161"">Technorati</a> really needs to add).</p>, <p>Given that <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=152"">Del.icio.us recently added search</a>, Raw Sugar may have a long hill to climb.</p>, <p>Overall, it’s a useful service that could use a little jazzing (and ajaxing) up of its user interface.

He is the founder of <a href=""http://www.blogcn.com/"">Blogcn</a>, one of the leading blog service providers in China. Chilling stuff:</p>, <p>Q: But, as you say, the political environment in China means there’s a lot that people can’t express in their blogs.</p>, <p>A: Sometimes there are people who write about Taiwanese independence and the Falun Gong.</p>, <p>Q: And what happens when they try to do that?</p>, <p>A: We set up keywords for our programs, like “Falun Gong,” and when you type in those keywords, you cannot post them. It just shows up as stars. Everybody has that.</p>, <p>Q: People can avoid using those words, though.</p>, <p>A: The problem exists, but it’s not a big one. We can immediately fix it, and it’s not a problem. Maybe there are some words that aren’t in the keywords, but if they’re published, they don’t fit the content. Then the Internet police will call us, and we will delete it within 24 hours. If it lasts on the site too long, then maybe it will make some trouble. Maybe I will have to go to the police station.</p>, <p>Q: How often have you had to do that?</p>, <p>A: That has never happened. The phone calls seldom happen -â€“ only four or five times in two years. We have a specialist who takes care of this. These people [who post the forbidden things] are not real bloggers. They know it will be deleted.</p>, <p>Q: There has been a lot of talk in the past few months about the Chinese government requiring bloggers who don’t use sites like yours to register their real names and contacts if they want to keep on blogging. How difficult is it for Blogcn users to set up their blogs?</p>, <p>A: To set up a blog you have to give your password, e-mail address, blogger name, and choose a template. It’s very easy. We don’t need their phone number, their address, their ID number. [The environment] is much better than before.

While that’s a small percentage, it does show healthy growth; in 2004, for example, only 6 percent of those surveyed regularly read blogs.”</p>, <p>* â€œThose who are hooked into Podcasts are an even smaller group, with only 7 percent of those surveyed having downloaded or listened to a Podcast regularly in the past year.

Attensa – The Smart RSS Reader,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.attensa.com"">Attensa</a> is a world class RSS reader that is attacking the multi-platform syncronization problem (I’ll explain that) and is also looking very seriously at the <a href=""http://www.attentiontrust.org"">attention</a> issue from a unique perspective (a good thing).</p>, <p>Attensa launched their first product at Gnomedex in June – an Outlook based reader that is lightning fast and has been getting <a href=""http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/2005/08/attensa_first_i.html"">rave reviews</a> (Jeff Nolan). It’s also free, for now.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.attensa.com/products.php"">Attensa for Outlook</a> supports enclosures, and so will automatically download things like podcasts and videocasts. Since it syncs with outlook, all content will be available for you to read when you are offline. This is a key feature for people who travel and aren’t online constantly, but want to be able to catch up on their feeds.</p>, <p>Attensa for Outlook is just the beginning, however. I spoke with Scott Niesen, Attensa’s Marketing Director, this evening and heard about their future product plans.</p>, <p>In a “couple of weeks” Attensa will be launching a private beta of their web-based RSS reader. It will fully syncronize your feeds with their outlook product. <u>It will also fully syncronize at the post level</u>, meaning if you’ve read a post on one product, it will not show up as unread in the other product. This is a key product feature and possible because Attensa’s engine runs at the server level for both products. Duplicate posts are a huge problem for power RSS users, and Attensa is making a serious attempt to solve this.</p>, <p>I’ll be included in the beta testing and Scott tells me that I can blog freely on the product, including screen shots. More on this when the product is soft-launched.</p>, <p>Later this year Attensa will roll out a mobile reader as well, rounding out the product set nicely.</p>, <p>For now, all products are free. Attensa has been <a href=""http://attensa.typepad.com/attensa/2005/07/pricing__the_qu.html"">polling users</a> to create an appropriate long-term pricing plan. Their current plan is to keep the web product free, and eventually charge a one time fee of $20 for the Outlook client. If a user want to use both products and syncronize feeds, Attensa will charge a yearly subscription fee of about $20 (but you won’t be charged for the Outlook client). $20 a year for this kind of high end product seems pretty reasonable to me.</p>, <p>No word from Attensa yet on their pricing plans for the mobile product, but I assume it would be rolled in with the subscription plan.</p>, <p>Attensa is looking at the <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=100"">Attention</a> issue very carefully. About half of my call with Scott was spent discussing their plans in this area.</p>, <p>They have a unique perspective on the opportunity. For a full discussion, see co-founder Eric Hayes <a href=""http://ehayes.typepad.com/ehayes/2005/08/attention_strea.html"">post on his personal blog</a>. Basically, Attensa will (with your opt-in permission) aggregate information about your reading habits to make your feed reading more efficient (<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=172"">something needs to be done</a> to make it possible to mow through hundreds and hundreds of feeds every day) .</p>, <p>Their idea? Watch what you read, what you click on, how long you spend reading something, what you ignore (just as important), and prioritze feeds and posts according to what they think you’ll want to read first. They’ll also suggest new feeds based on what you seem to be liking. I, for one, am more than happy to give up a little privacy if I get efficiency and good recommendations in return.</p>, <p>Craig Barnes: Co-Founder, CEO<br/>

It’s sent to your friends and, if you desire, to the entire Gahabunga community (talk about pressure). They rate the person’s <strike>intellect, personality and overall charisma</strike> physical hotness.</p>, <p>You get the opinions of your friends and the Gahbunga community in moments.

Gahbunga will then send the photo to your friends and if you choose, to other members of the Gahbunga community. Gahbunga will then ask your friends and community members to ‘rate’ your date. The results will be sent to your phone within an hour. The rest is up to you!</p>, <p>Yes, people will be offended. But this is an interesting experiment. Right? I dunno.

Ojos – Auto Name & Tag Your Photos,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.ojos-inc.com"">Ojos</a> hasn’t launched yet, and may even change it’s name. But a bit of buzz has started about them already, stoked by a post by <a href=""http://blogs.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2005/08/_its_also_an_ex.html"">Rob Hof at Businessweek</a> and followed by <a href=""http://www.hojohnlee.com/weblog/archives/2005/08/25/ojos/"">Ho John Lee</a>.</p>, <p>The company’s founders include Burak Gokturk, a Stanford Ph.D. who holds 15 patents in facial recognition (according to Rob Hof) (other team members below), which gives us some idea of what they are up to. The idea behind Ojos is that they will take the photos stored on your hard drive and apply face and text recognition technologies to guess who and what is included in a photo. Tag one photo including a person, and Ojos can automatically tag all other pictures that include that person with the same tags. It sounds simple, but the the technology needed to do this is not.</p>, <p>The way I am thinking of this is that Ojos solves the long tail problem with my thousands of unnamed, untagged photos. Sure, I put the occasional picture up on <a href=""http://www.flickr.com"">flickr</a> and <a href=""http://www.buzznet.com/"">buzznet</a> and go to the trouble of tagging them, but the vast majority are simply filed away on my hard drive under a general topic and month the picture was taken. This could fix that.</p>, <p>One of the co-founders, Munjal Shah, has started a blog and has <a href=""http://munjal.typepad.com/recognizing_deven/2005/08/us_in_business_.html"">posted</a> occasionally on Ojos with additional information.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Ojos has also hired <a href=""http://www.horsepigcow.com/index.html"">Tara Hunt</a>, who I’ve been bugging daily for an invite to the alpha (no luck yet).</p>, <p>She did send me a very small screen shot of some pictures that have been processed with Ojos – see image to left. I’m pretty sure she gave me permission to post this. :-)  The image includes pictures of Tara over the years, identified and organized by Ojos. It recognized her even through hair color changes.</p>, <p>Tara has also <a href=""http://www.horsepigcow.com/2005/08/people-are-starting-to-talk.html"">posted a few hints</a> about Ojos.</p>, <p>If you’d like to get in line for the beta, send an email to “beta at ojos-inc.com”.

Google Purge will, apparently, be an effort to <u>destroy all information that Google is otherwise unable to index</u>.  I’m a big fan of the Onion, and they really nailed it this time.</p>, <p>From the article:</p>, <p>The new project, dubbed Google Purge, will join such popular services as Google Images, Google News, and Google Maps, which catalogs the entire surface of the Earth using high-resolution satellites.</p>, <p>As a part of Purge’s first phase, executives will destroy all copyrighted materials that cannot be searched by Google. </p>, <p>And later:</p>, <p>“Book burning is just the beginning,” said Google co-founder Larry Page. “This fall, we’ll unveil Google Sound, which will record and index all the noise on Earth. Is your baby sleeping soundly? Does your high-school sweetheart still talk about you? Google will have the answers.”</p>, <p>Page added: “And thanks to Google Purge, anything our global microphone network can’t pick up will be silenced by noise-cancellation machines in low-Earth orbit.”</p>, <p>As a part of Phase One operations, Google executives will permanently erase the hard drive of any computer that is not already indexed by the Google Desktop Search.</p>, <p>“We believe that Google Desktop Search is the best way to unlock the information hidden on your hard drive,” Schmidt said. “If you haven’t given it a try, now’s the time.

Writely – Process Words with your Browser,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Imagine Word, but as an ajax browser application that was free. And allowed tagging of documents. And you could set reader permissions for each document you create and allow others to edit the document, or just read it. That’s what <a href=""http://www.writely.com"">Writely</a> is.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.solutionwatch.com/205/writely-the-web-word-processor/"">Brian Benzinger at Solution Watch</a> pointed it out to me this evening during a long Google Talk chat.  It is a very functional word processor with most of the bells and whistles you’d expect – a range of fonts and styles, embedded images (up to 2 megs each), spell checker, etc. It has a fantastic wysiwyg editor. It also has an option to upload and/or save in Word format.</p>, <p>So the Writely guys and gals built the core feature set with an ajax UI, and then they went a step further and added some cool web 2.0 stuff. In addition to naming a document, you can allow others to edit it, or allow them read-only status. Documents can also be tagged for easy searches later – a nice touch. Writely is also completely free during its beta stage.</p>, <p>In many ways, this is a wiki with a nice wysiwyg front end (I keep thinking of <a href=""http://www.wikiwyg.net/"">wikiwyg</a>), plus the ability to set permissions.</p>, <p>However, it is also more than that</p>, <p>Writely is a highly specialized niche application built with ajax. Ajax allows this (and other applications) to act very much like desktop apps. Stuff like this must get Microsoft’s attention…How long will it be before a <a href=""http://ajaxoffice.sourceforge.net/"">full suite of platform-independent ajax-enabled office applications</a> becomes available? If all you need is a browser to open and edit these documents, the huge network effect enjoyed by Microsoft Office could simply vanish.</p>, <p>For more information on Writely, see their blog <a href=""http://writely.blogspot.com/"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.himysk.com/collaborative-authoring-just-got-easier/"">Shadows in Motion</a>.</p>]"
Skype Now Has Call Forwarding,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.skype.com"">Skype</a> (previous <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=70"">profile</a>) <a href=""http://www.skype.com/products/skype/windows/"">released a new beta version</a> – 1.4.0.45 – of their client today.</p>, <p>There are a bunch of new features (all are listed below), but there is one that really interesting feature that in my opinion changes the whole VOIP game. Skype now has a true call forwarding feature, <u>allowing you to forward Skype calls to any normal phone, even when you are offline Skype.</u></p>, <p>I hadn’t picked up on this until I read a great Skype blog called <a href=""http://zog.typepad.com/malaysia/2005/09/skype_newest_be.html"">Jan in Malaysia</a> a few minutes ago. Call forwarding in an of itself is not new for Skype – <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=119"">Jyve</a> has had a call forwarding feature in their Skype add-on for some time.</p>, <p>However, with Jyve, you had to be logged in to Skype for calls to forward. It was a necessary limitation (out of Jyve’s control), but when I’m logged into Skype I <em>don’t need</em> calls forwarded. It’s when I’m logged out and away from my computer that I want this.</p>, <p>So when I saw this I got pretty excited. But it is not clear from the Skype <a href=""http://www.skype.com/products/skype/windows/"">download page</a> or their <a href=""http://support.skype.com/index.php?_a=knowledgebase&amp;_j=questiondetails&amp;_i=304&amp;nav=+%26gt%3B+%3Ca+href%3D%27index.php%3F_a%3Dknowledgebase%26_j%3Dsubcat%26_i%3D9%27%3ESkype+for+Windows%3C%2Fa%3E"">FAQs</a> whether or not you had to be logged in for call forwarding to work.</p>, <p>So I tested it. Jan and I each called eachother when we were logged off, and Skype dutifully forwarded the calls to our cell phones. Perfect!</p>, <p>Under advanced settings, you can actually set three separate forwarding numbers, and each will ring in the order you set. When you are offline, a special icon appears letting people know they can call you and it will forward to a normal phone.</p>, <p>Here are all of the new features:</p>, <p><strong>What are the new Skype features [in Skype for Windows 1.4 Beta]?</strong></p>, <p>1.Call Forwarding â€“ You can set your Skype client to forward to 1 or multiple PSTN numbers simultaneously, or to another Skype name.</p>, <p>2.Peronalise Skype â€“ You can choose from a wide selection of sounds, ringtones and pictures to customize your Skype experience!</p>, <p>3.Improved Search and Add a Contact functions — cleaner, more intuitive features and layout… and smarter results!</p>, <p>4.Friendlier Getting Started &amp; Import Contact Wizards &amp; visual setup guides &amp; dynamic tooltips — make getting started even easier!</p>, <p>5.One-click calls from any website with Outlook and IE toolbars</p>, <p>6.Improved Voice Quality</p>, <p>7.New Skype sounds!</p>]"

Derek Powazek at Technorati also posts on Blog Finder <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/weblog/2005/09/44.html"">here</a>.</p>, <p>What is it? It’s a ranked list of blogs. By Tag.

Here’s <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/blogs/web2.0"">Web 2.0</a>. Here’s <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/blogs/skype"">Skype</a>.</p>, <p>How good is it? I think it has some problems. Tags are publisher created and so publishers will add a lot of them, and will have an incentive to push the envelope on what is considered an appropriate tag for their blog. I believe, for instance, that I could make TechCrunch a very popular cooking site simply by adding the tag “cooking” to the TechCrunch blog.</p>, <p>There are three ways tags are added. Technorati has already tagged “over 2 million blogs” according to Sifry, and that appears to be accurate. The other two way tags are added are via publisher tools (note the text below is tailored to add a “web2.0” tag):</p>, <p> Get in here! To add your blog to this page, <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/account/#blogs"">claim your blog</a> and add “web2.0” to your blog tags, or put <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/blogs/web2.0#taglink"">this code</a> on your site.</p>, <p>Technorati did do a pretty good job of selecting tags that describe Techcrunch, however.

Rojo’s lists use tags that readers have used to describe individual posts that a blog has published. See our profile update here for <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=164"">details</a>. I do, however, believe that lists, if they are useful, must be subject based.

Intel Beats 2Q Earnings but Investors Wary,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/intel""><img class=""shot2"" src=""http://www.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0001/0592/10592v1-max-250x250.jpg""/></a></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/intel"">Intel</a>‘s second quarter profits were up 25% from one year ago, with good guidance for the rest of the year, but remarkably the stock remained unchanged for the day.</p>, <p>Net income for the quarter was <a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/intel-posts-25-jump-quarterly/story.aspx?guid={935660C0-FE86-4E06-B25A-97922AB5FDB4}&amp;dist=msr_8"">$1.6 billion</a>, while analysts forecasts were for $1.28 billion.  They expects 3rd quarter revenue to fall between $10 billion and $10.6 billion, in contrast to analysts’ estimates of $10.05 billion. According to CEO Paul Otellini, “As we enter the second half, demand remains strong for our microprocessor and chipset products in all segments and all parts of the globe”, so why aren’t investors as optimistic?</p>, <p>The biggest contributing factor was news this morning of European legislators <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSBNG5346020080716"">expanding their antitrust charges</a> against the company.  New charges could be filed against this company this week, claiming Intel gave European Retailers incentives to too sell rival, AMD’s, chips. With similar lawsuits brewing in South Korea, Japan, and the US; Intel could face heavy fines.</p>, <p>Intel not being viewed as the high growth company is used to be, might be another reason for investors not budging at the news.  According to <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=conewsstory&amp;refer=conews&amp;tkr=INTC:US&amp;sid=a3bLxzy8TIVU"">Bloomberg</a>, analysts expect sales to rise only 4% for the year, which is half the rate in 2007.  Sales also increased only 7% in the 2nd quarter compared to an average of 12% for the previous 3.</p>, <p>The weakening Global economy will impact the semiconductor and chip industry.  Last quarter global chip <a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/144196/chip_sales_down_but_not_out_gartner_says.html"">revenue declined 7%</a>, and chip inventories fell about 14.6% which means that that chip manufacturers are cutting back on production, fearing worse times to come.  Intel hasn’t been hit as hard as others, but without a clear exit out of this economic slowdown, Intel’s bottom line could be effected by the end of the year.</p>, <p>Intel is down around 20% so far year to date, but has a much stronger outlook than one year ago.  With increasing demands in developing countries, and the introduction of the Atom chip, Intel has the potential to beat all analysts expectations for the coming year. The company is also facing a lot of pricing pressure from AMD, which could see margins further drop. Consumers are no longer as interested in the fastest and most expensive PC’s, as today a $1000 PC with a $150 CPU will usually suffice.</p>]"
Iconize Me – Online Caricatures for $15,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.iconizeme.com/index2.html"">Iconize Me</a> will create a hand-drawn caricature of a picture that you supply to them, for $15. <a href=""http://dv-graphics.com/iconizeme/samples.html"">See samples here</a>.</p>, <p>Iconize Me is the creation of <a href=""http://www.dv-graphics.com/about.html"">Paul Sahner</a> and <a href=""http://www.dv-graphics.com/about.html"">Shalimar Luis</a> and is based in New York.</p>, <p>The service was launched two years ago, but was re-launched recently. They use Adobe Illustrator to draw and color, Adobe Photoshop so make JPEGs and GIFs, and IconFactory IconBuilder Pro to make the icons. In their <a href=""http://dv-graphics.com/iconizeme/faq.html"">FAQs</a> they state that they’ve created over 1,200 icons.</p>, <p>No real technology here, but the design is very, very good. The results are fun to view and the price is right. In fact, the price might be too low. The service seems to be in a perpetual backlog – every time I’ve <a href=""http://dv-graphics.com/iconizeme/buy.html"">checked</a> they are not taking any additional orders.</p>, <p>The concept behind Iconize Me! is pretty simple: After sending DV Graphics an order and a photo of yourself, we start off on creating a custom caricature of you (or friend, or relative) based on the photo. The end result is then sent off to you as an icon file (for use on the computer), a GIF file (for use on the internet) and you also have the option of ordering fantastic, high-quality JPEG and PDF files.</p>, <p>Using a fairly basic hand drawing and coloring technique that we call Digital Ink, we are able to provide you with an amazingly high-quality portrait. Every inch of every icon is hand drawn and hand colored in vector format. It’s as if you were sitting in front of us and we created your portrait on the spot using natural tools. Unlike our old system, we don’t use the paint bucket tool to simply fill in vast areas of color, using tints and shades. Each color now is mixed and created for each individual spot. We do the best we can to replicate real-life drawing.</p>, <p>You can pay an additional fee for high res jpeg and vector pdf files of the caricature.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>There is a sister service called <a href=""http://www.iconizeme.com/vector/index.html"">Vectorize Me</a> that costs a little more – $35 – and creates a full “portrait” based on the picture you supply them. Portraits are delivered as vector files, which are endlessly enlargeable without pixelization and can therefore be blown up to any desired size.</p>, <p>JD Lasica <a href=""http://www.newmediamusings.com/blog/2003/11/have_you_been_i.html"">blogged</a> about Iconize Me way back in 2003. Dan Costa <a href=""http://spaces.msn.com/members/technologyfilter/Blog/cns!1pClK6dT9GE9XXDwAqQxHgyQ!567.entry"">wrote about them</a> more recently.</p>]"

The REST-like Query interface is available to all GoGrid users, and includes some noteworthy features.</p>, <p>The API allows user’s to programmatically control their GoGrid environment.  This allows users to, for example, auto-scale the GoGrid instance in a timely and efficient manner.  The API also enables users to script and chain various commands.  For instance, one can simply type “get” available unused IP addresses, “add” a server with unassigned IP, “power” a server when it is ready, etc.  It can also be used by resellers to skin their own portals, and allows for 3rd party developers to create management tools for GoGrid instances.  It requires no knowledge of WSDL, CORBA or RMI to use, and supports API calls from Java, PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby and C# as well as shell scripting language like bash.</p>, <p>GoGrid delivers similar on-demand, pay-by-the-hour server hosting as Amazon’s EC2, but uniquely offers a web-based GUI, Windows Cloud servers, free load balancing, and free support deals.</p>]"

But I get ahead of myself.</p>, <p>For those of you who don’t know, PocketMod is a flash program that allows you to print modules on a piece of paper, so that you can refer to it and take notes on it later.

Yes, I wrote about new companies (and there are some very interesting ones), but every day brought more heartbreaking news about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina"">Hurricane Katrina</a>. By late Thursday night, I was reading <a href=""http://neworleans.metblogs.com/"">one thing</a> on <a href=""http://slidell.weblogswork.com/"">blogs</a> and hearing just the opposite from our federal and state leaders. Like others, I just couldn’t focus on writing about new companies, and I took <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=198"">Friday off</a> from blogging entirely.</p>, <p>The weekend has brought better news – record donations from US citizens, aid is flooding in from most of the world, and more people are being rescued. But there is still a very long way to go before things are back to “normal”. And now the political shit-throwing will start in earnest.</p>, <p>If you can, consider <a href=""http://arc.convio.net/site/PageServer?pagename=ntld_main"">donating to the red cross</a> or other charity of your choice, and for the bloggers out there, see the <a href=""http://www.redcross.org/psa/bannerorder/all/"">red cross banner page</a> where you can put up an image and link for those wishing to donate.</p>, <p>I spent the week in Palo Alto. I am moving to the area this month and finding a house to rent took a long time. I did find one, though, in Atherton, and I’ll be moving in on September 12. We’ll be having an open TechCrunch party there sometime in October, and all are welcome (a wiki for the party will come soon and I’ll announce it on the site).</p>, <p>I also had some great meetings this week. Keith Teare and I met with <a href=""http://susanmernit.blogspot.com/2005/09/drinks-with-techcrunch.html"">Susan Mernit</a> at a wonderful <a href=""http://www.vinolocale.com/"">wine garden</a> she recommended in Palo Alto.

During our talk, <a href=""http://www.ventureblog.com/"">David Hornik</a> walked by and hung out with us for a bit as well.</p>, <p>And possibly the most interesting meeting of the week was with Sam Schillace, one of the founders of <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=192"">Writely</a>, an ajax powered online word processor that is getting a ton of buzz.

Furthermore, RSS can literally be used with just about any kind of web-based content. RSS fundamentally is a relatively simple specification that uses XML to organize and format web-based content in a standard way.</p>, <p>Fred Wilson <a href=""http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/09/email_vs_rss_co.html"">writes</a> about where his readers come from, and reveals some very interesting data on the relative popularity of Email v. RSS feeds. The bottom line is that only about a third of his readers access his content via RSS. The rest come directly to the site, or read his daily emails.</p>, <p>Web Page Views in August:  ~90,000<br/>
Web Visits in August: ~60,000<br/>
Web Unique Visitors in August: No Idea, but I’d guess around 10,000<br/>
Email Subscribers: 1055<br/>
RSS Subscribers: ~5500</p>, <p>And later:</p>, <p>The fact is that of the approximately 17,000 people who make up my audience, only a third of them use RSS.  And my readers are probably more technical than the average reader (only half use Internet Explorer for example and almost 40% use Firefox).</p>, <p>Ajax and other online office type applications are springing up all over the place. Richard MacManus goes to the trouble of finding many of them and writes about them <a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/002814.php"">here</a>. To be honest, there aren’t any good full-suite solutions yet. <a href=""http://ajaxoffice.sourceforge.net/"">AjaxOffice</a> is just a web page with a stated intention. <a href=""http://www.writely.com"">Writely</a> has an excellent ajax word processor, but needs to build the rest.

Fooky Tests AI Search,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Ed Dunn has been developing <a href=""http://www.fooky.com"">Fooky</a> since 1999. While it’s currently in private beta, I’ve had the opportunity to swap emails with Ed and check out the service in its current form. There is definitely something interesting about the service, and it will be worth checking out once it goes live. For now, you can view low quality screen shots on the home page and view a <a href=""http://www.fooky.com/mainmenu.html"">flash presentation</a> that includes additional information.</p>, <p>The uniqueness of Fooky lies in its approach to artificial intelligence and natural language commands, as well as a clean interface:</p>, <p>Fooky.com uses a single textbox interface as its primary input source. Users can input phrases, commands or conversation to process information. Fooky do not prefer Boolean text searches, opting to search keywords separated by comma to get actually what is requested. Users can also enter direct commands such as â€œget stock quote for S” or â€œget traffic for Chicago” to go directly to rich content, not hyperlinks. Also users can enjoy conversation with Fooky.com by simply typing in â€œhello” or â€œhow are you” in the textbox interface. As more users have conversation with Fooky.com, it will get smarter and able to launch the secret â€œArtificial Friend” service once a threshold is met.</p>, <p>Fooky.com uses multiple spiders and in-house processors to locate and filter web sites for quality and relevance. Fooky.com is one of the few destination sites that consider the quality of the web sites indexed seriously. Our spiders are able to read web code and determine if the site is using tactics designed to hijack the browser settings or download code without user knowledge. Fooky.com use a scoring system based on various factors including the presentation of the site home page, the web site operator credibility as a business or organization and use of code or techniques such as pop-up or pop-under pages.</p>, <p>Web site operators will find Fooky.com use of their web site Meta tags more practical, cost efficient and beneficial to their business than bidding for generic keywords. By embracing Meta tag usage, web site operators are empowered to control their Meta information and search criteria on their terms. Fooky.com is able to embrace Meta tags by its quality inclusion policy that believes quality web sites provide quality Meta information that can be trusted.</p>, <p>Ed is also thinking ahead to the mobile market and the need for simple text and voice input mechanisms:</p>, <p><strong>Why would someone choose Fooky.com over Yahoo, Google and MSN?</strong></p>, <p>I believe people will appreciate how easier and practical it is to query and retrieve content. Fooky.com is also designed to move beyond the desktop with ease. Our phrase-based model makes it easier for mobile devices. On a mobile phone for example, it is easier to key in a command â€œget showtimes for 60618″ than click down levels of theatre related hyperlinks. When the automotive industry get wired, Fooky.com can seamlessly allow voice recognition to process phrase-based commands such as â€œget traffic for Chicago”</p>, <p>It’s too early to point the thumb up or down for Fooky, but we look forward to seeing the live service. In the meantime, I highly recommend running the <a href=""http://www.fooky.com/mainmenu.html"">flash presentation</a> in 4-5 browser windows simultaneously. The music is cool, and you can get an awesome beat going when it overlaps with itself. :-)</p>]"

A better  information architecture would make that information more readily available.</p>, <p>I also think the site is a full generation behind the state of the art – adding ajax would speed things up somewhat and significantly reduce necessary clicks and refreshes.

To get past the login page you need a valid .edu college/university email address, and I am not a college student.</p>, <p>More news came out last Friday, September 2. FaceBook <a href=""http://hs.facebook.com/hsregister.php"">began allowing</a> high school students to join the network, significantly increasing their target market.</p>, <p>I emailed FaceBook over the weekend and requested an interview. Chris Hughes wrote back and said he’d be delighted. We spoke today. And Chris, great guy that he is, gave me access to the site via a demo account. I was finally able to see what FaceBook was all about. By the way, the screen shot above is the demo account profile. The Kramer picture is a nice touch, I think.</p>, <p>This will be a longer than normal post since most of us can’t simply try the service out for ourselves. I’ve organized my notes under the subjects of “membership,” “functionality,”  and “business model”.</p>, <p>To become a college member of facebook you must have a .edu college/university email address. Most colleges issue these to students.</p>, <p>Facebook supports 882 colleges today – there are about 2,000 in the U.S. if you count community colleges. Their goal is to support all of these over time.</p>, <p>The penetration rate is staggering – about 85% of students in supported colleges have a profile up on FaceBook. <u>That’s 3.85 million members</u>. Chris tells me that 60% log in <em>daily</em>. About 85% log in at least once a week, and 93% log in at least once a month.</p>, <p>With the addition of high schools – there are approximately 22,000 in the U.S., Facebook’s target market increases substantially. Chris tells me “tens of thousands” of high school students have joined since the functionality was launched last friday.</p>, <p>Becoming a member as a high school student is a bit easier. High schools generally do not issue email addresses, and so there is no requirement for an active .edu email account. Current high school members can invite others. Once you start college, you have the opportunity to change the account over to whatever school you attend.</p>, <p>Also, Chris tells me that recent alums (who can remain members) are maintaining the same log in rates as current members.</p>, <p>The demo account profile can be <a href=""http://facebook.com/p.php?id=11752&amp;l=732749925d"">viewed here</a>.</p>, <p>In addition to  basic personal information, users are encouraged to add additional descriptive information about themselves to build out their identity. Users can add favorite music, books, movies, quotes, etc. Every entry is linked to search results where users can see others who share the same interests.</p>, <p>Users can also form and/or join groups. Examples are political and social groups. However, about 80% are “fun” related, such as “I love NY”.</p>, <p>Additional functionality includes events (party notices, etc.) and messages (email).</p>, <p>Users can interact in a number of ways. You can add friends (must be mutually accepted), and you can also “poke” another member, which is a way of saying “hello”.</p>, <p>The biggest use of the site appears to be dating…as you can see from this very funny independent <a href=""http://www.frostedworld.com/Facebook.mov"">movie</a> that I found on FaceBook. It’s long, but I highly recommend it if you are trying to get a feel for the service.</p>, <p>FaceBook has three methods of producing revenue.</p>, <p>Mark Zuckerberg – Founder, CEO<br/>

Top Ten Things You Can Do To Get Blogged,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">Our primary goal here at TechCrunch is to profile new web 2.0 companies. Finding and experiencing what new companies have to offer is exciting for us. It what gets us up in the morning. We are honestly deeply passionate about this stuff.</p>, <p>Usually, the passion, drive and intelligence of the creators is reflected in the company or product they create. And even if a product is very young and/or doesn’t necessarily have a high chance for commercial success, there are usually features that carry our mutual thinking on web 2.0 further along. We try very hard to dig for those forward-thinking features and highlight them on this site. Doing one thing in a spectacular and inspiring fashion and nine things stupidly is far, far better than doing ten things “well”. “Well” is boring.</p>, <p>We find new companies primarily in three ways. First, we scour hundreds of blog and news feeds daily to see whatâ€™s new. Second, we get a number of tips (often anonymously) about new stuff â€“ usually these are the most interesting new products. The third way is a direct request from the company itself.</p>, <p>We receive on average 5-10 email requests a day to be profiled. Usually we’ll write about one of these, meaning if a company sends in an email request to be profiled, they have a 10-20% chance of getting up on the site.</p>, <p>This is not a hard rule but more of an observation. I believe that if more companies approached us differently, a much higher percentage would be blogged. I’ve decided to humbly submit my advice on how to approach us in requesting a profile – I think this advice will work well with other bloggers as well.</p>, <p>You can also use your blog to promote bloggers who write about you. Other bloggers will see this and want to write about you too.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.buzzmachine.com/index.php/2005/08/13/wired/"">Jeff Jarvis says</a></p>, <p>In this new world, links are currency. Links grant authority. Links build branding. Links equal value.</p>, <p>If you don’t have a blog, you don’t even have a wallet, let alone currency. Having a blog gives you a tangible way to say thank you” to bloggers who write about you.</p>, <p>Encourage your employees to blog too. Go easy on the blogging policy in the early days.</p>, <p>If someone just won’t write about you, move on to another blogger. Don’t heckle them. If someone does write about you and you don’t like what they say, deal with it by sending an email or leaving a clarifying comment. Don’t attack. Other bloggers will see it and avoid you like the plague.</p>, <p>It’s hard to determine tone in a written blurb. Bloggers easily take offense. Think twice before you post something that can be taken the wrong way, and be very quick to apologize if you screw up. Don’t try to explain yourself – just apologize. If you are going to say something nasty or controversial, do it via email, not in a public comment.</p>, <p>One example of this came up today. 9rules network has been adding blogs to their network and people have been writing about them. <a href=""http://9rules.com/blog/author/scrivs/"">Paul Scrivens</a> doesn’t like the fact that people sometimes refer to 9rules as 9Rules (capital R), and Mike Rundle <a href=""http://9rules.com/blog/2005/09/a-little-brand-cleanup/"">wrote</a> an arguably condescending post about it today on the 9rules blog that said:</p>, <p>Since our company/service/network is getting links from everywhere nowadays, I wanted to quickly clear up some confusion regarding the name of what it is weâ€™re doing.</p>, <p>The company is â€œ9rules, Inc.” and the network is “The 9rules Network” or just “9rules.”</p>, <p>These capital R’s dropped everywhere are making our CEO cry in public, and believe me, that’s not pretty. Lowercase r’s are where its at. Uppercase is for suckers :) </p>, <p>The post was picked up by <a href=""http://www.turboblogger.com/2005/09/its-9rules-not-9rules/"">TurboBlogger</a> and <a href=""http://www.blogherald.com/2005/09/07/how-not-to-show-appreciation-to-those-who-link/"">BlogHerald</a> and 9rules has been roundly trashed in comments.</p>, <p>Bad idea. Don’t do stuff like this. Once you have done it, apologize immediately and sincerely.</p>, <p>I won’t even bring up the <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=182"">Rollyo</a> thing. Perfect example of how poor/hasty communication can hurt a company. Like I said, bloggers are touchy and I’m a blogger. The company handled this the right way and in the end everything was fine.</p>, <p>Please comment and tell me what I’ve missed.</p>]"
Gmail Now A Major Spam Hub,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/product/gmail""><img class=""shot2"" src=""http://www.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0001/2806/12806v2-max-250x250.jpg"" style=""float:right;""/></a></p>, <p>When <a href=""http://gmail.com"">Gmail</a> first launched, it was lauded for its spam filtering and security – there was no spam leaving the systems and almost no spam coming in. But all that has changed as a study from Roaring Penguin has <a href=""http://www.allspammedup.com/2008/07/spammers-choose-gmail/"">found that</a> spam originating from Gmail has risen from 6.8 to 27% in just the last month. The impetus for the big jump is likely to be that the Google account registration CAPTCHA has been completely defeated and almost doesn’t even stand in the way anymore.</p>, <p>We pronounced that <a href=""http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/07/05/the-end-of-captchas-as-a-security-mechanism/"">CAPTCHA’s were dead</a> some weeks ago, as there are now hundreds of thousands of ready-to-go accounts for Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo now available to purchase online. With Gmail now responsible for 27% of spam, the trust mechanisms have completely broken down to the point where Google must take some drastic action to filter out automated users who are sending out bulk email.</p>, <p>They could do that by throttling the number of outbound emails, and some common sense user tracking. I don’t think any real user would be sending thousands of emails an hours, like most of the spamming scripts do – so it shouldn’t be too hard to detect and shutdown. Google have a big problem on their hands, and it will affect other Gmail users as the email coming out of the system is now being treated with increased suspicion by other mail handlers.</p>]"

SearchFox – Personalized RSS Reader,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://rss.searchfox.com"">SearchFox</a> is in private beta testing of a potentially disruptive RSS reader. It’s the first product I’ve seen that does a good job of prioritizing new content from feeds based on your historical reading behavior, as well as data gathered from the SearchFox community as a whole.</p>, <p>This is a very big problem that I’ve written about many times. RSS readers are great for sorting through content, up to a point – after a couple of hundred feeds there is simply too much information to go through quickly. Companies are now trying to tackle the problems faced by the power users – those reading hundreds of feeds daily, in the hope that in solving their problems they will create a product that addresses the needs of the masses as well.</p>, <p>Since they are in private beta, you’ll need to request an invitation to try the product out now. Esteban Kozak at Search Fox tells me they still have a few left, but they have almost invited the quota.</p>, <p>There are a number of preset feeds when you log in for the first time, which I promptly deleted. Adding new feeds was fairly simple – no problems with adding feeds one at a time. Although there is functionality to import an opml file (the standard file format for RSS feeds), I was not able to successfully import my file. I’ll be trying again and it may be an issue on my end.</p>, <p>I’ve only been using it for a couple of days, but I am already seeing how the prioritization works and I’m fairly happy with the decisions it is making. Estaban tells me via email that after a couple of weeks of use the results will be even better:</p>, <p>Our RSS reader learns by watching what individuals and the entire community find interesting, taking into account various inputs such as source, author, and topic of the an RSS entry. Existing RSS readers only show information chronologically, which quickly leads to information overload. Our goal is to that you see whatâ€™s interesting to you on the first page, rather than on the 20th page. Initial studies show that our personalization engine surfaces 50% of the interesting posts to the first page after a week of use, and reaches the 90% level after two weeks of use. </p>, <p>Search Fox also has a nice interface – inlcuding easy links to save, mark as read, email link, and delete. One of my favorite features is the ability to expand or contract a post without a page refresh.</p>, <p>Robert Scoble <a href=""http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/08.html#a11058"">wrote</a> about Search Fox last week, and <a href=""http://siliconbeat.com/entries/2005/09/06/notable_links_about_silicon_valley_startupsand_failures.html"">Matt Marshall</a> mentioned them briefly as well.

Apple Claims Exclusive Use To The Word 'Pod',"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""ipod.jpg"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.crunchgear.com/wp-content/uploads/ipod.jpg""/>Apple has been stepping up its campaign to stomp down on other companies’ use of the word “Pod” in any of their products.

Writely is a proprietary, hosted application (although they import and export in Word and other formats). Zimbra is an open source project, and is presented only in demo form at this point – if you want to run it you have to do so on your own servers.</p>, <p>So while Zimbra is not something you can immediately start using, you can view a hosted demo <a href=""http://www.zimbra.com/demo/"">here</a> and a flash demo <a href=""http://www.zimbra.com/flash_demo/flash_demo.html"">here</a>.

It can be accessed in three ways, although the back end service is the same regardless of how you access it:</p>, <p>Advanced search options can be viewed <a href=""http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch/advanced_blog_search"">here</a>.</p>, <p>Blogs that use a ping server such as <a href=""http://www.weblogs.com"">Weblogs.com</a> (<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=75"">profile</a>) have been indexed since June 2005, so older posts are not included in the index.</p>, <p>The engine generally points to posts only, although if there is a good match to your query for an entire blog, Google points to the blog above normal search results (see screen shot below).</p>, <p>You can used the advanced search features to restrict search to certain languages (35 supported languages).</p>, <p>Additional information can be found in the <a href=""http://www.google.com/help/about_blogsearch.html"">FAQs</a>.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/googleblogsearch1.png""/></p>, <p>The interface is clean. The engine is unquestionably fast. About as fast as normal Google searches. However, since their indes only goes back to June, it is unfair to compare it to existing blog search engines.</p>, <p>Google is indexing posts by <a href=""http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/weblog/2005/09/google_launches.html"">crawling the XML feeds rather than the post html</a>. This allows for significantly more structured data (date, author, categorites, etc.). However, if the XML feed only includes a summary of the post (as very many do), the full text of the post will not be indexed (and therefore cannot be searched). Relevant information will not be found.</p>, <p>Speed is a crucial issue and if they can maintain current search speeds over time, it will be a very large competitive advantage.</p>, <p>Search results can be sorted by date or “relevance”. Sorting by relevance is the default.</p>, <p>A few people are noting deficiencies in the current product. <a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/002825.php"">Richard MacManus</a> says:</p>, <p>But… is it just me, or is Google Blog Search pretty tame/lame? I don’t think Technorati should give up its day job just yet, despite being hammered in the blogosphere lately.</p>, <p>David Sifry (CEO of Technorati) <a href=""http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000340.html"">gives more detail</a>, saying:</p>, <p>I’m sure that they’ll continue to improve over the coming months, perhaps including tags, recent images and links, zeitgeists, blogger tools, and other types of semistructured data. I’m sure that they’ll also start indexing the full-text of blog posts, not just the partial text found in most blog feeds.</p>, <p>Overall, significant room for improvement exists.</p>, <p>Google Blog Search is fast and the ability to sort by relevance or date is an important features. However, Google search is not a category killer like the original Google search was. Competitors took a much expected hit today, but they are still standing.</p>]"
Profile – Last.fm,"[<p class=""profile clearfix""><img alt=""LastFM"" class=""logo"" src=""http://webreakstuff.com/blog/wp-content/lastfm.gif"" style=""float:right;""/><strong>Company:</strong> <a href=""http://www.last.fm"">Last.fm</a><br/>
<strong>Location:</strong> London<br/>
<strong>Launched:</strong> 2002, redesigned in 2005</p>, <p id=""speakable-summary"">With applications like <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/pandora"">Pandora</a> (<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=187"">profile</a>) getting some attention from the blogosphere, it’s time to shed some light on another music-related project that’s been around for some time now and that I’m quite fond of – <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/last.fm"">Last.fm</a>. Last FM (now merged with the Audioscrobbler project) allows you to generate a profile of your musical taste based on what you like or listen to the most. Here’s how they put it:</p>, <p>You get your own online music profile that you can fill up with the music you like. This information is used to create a personal radio station and to find users who are similar to you. Last.fm can even play you new artists and songs you might like. It’s addictive, it’s growing, it’s free, it’s music.</p>, <p><img alt=""lastfm"" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/lastfm.jpg""/> Last.fm, like Pandora, suggests bands and tracks based on your current taste, but it is Last.fm’s social network-based approach that makes it interesting. Last.fm generates recommendations from your musical tastes by compiling a list of your musical neighbours (people who listen to the same things you do) and suggests bands they also play and that you don’t. This organically built ecosystem of relationships between people and their musical tastes is what makes Last.fm stand out from the competition.</p>, <p>Being out there for longer also has its advantages like the huge user-base and the amazing extra capabilities of the system like the stand-alone player, that keeps playing new music for you until you grow tired of being suddenly so musically rich and go back to your own tracks.</p>, <p>A lot else could be said about Last.fm because I’m one of those guys who’s completely in love with the system but there’s nothing like the joy of discovery, so I’m going to leave it to you to <a href=""http://www.last.fm"">click this link and explore it yourself</a>. People who are curious about the architectural diferences between Last.fm and Pandora can read <a href=""http://webreakstuff.com/blog/2005/08/pandora-what-about-lastfm/"">this post</a> on my <a href=""http://webreakstuff.com/blog/"">personal blog</a>, that talks about just that.

Meebo – Instant Messaging with Ajax,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Meebo, an ajax-rich web-based instant messenger application, launched today. It’s elegant and useful.</p>, <p>There are a number of problems with instant messaging. First, most of us have too many client applications to run at one time (skype, msn, AOL, Yahoo, Google Talk, Meetro, etc…) (solutions like Trillian attempt to solve this). Second, if you are away from your base computer, you may not be able to access the software needed to run IM. Meebo solves this by allowing you to log into AOL, ICQ, MSN and Yahoo instant messaging services from their web page.</p>, <p>Since Meebo uses ajax, you can drag and drop the message boxes around the screen. And the core functionality (making IM more useful and easy to use) is quite nice.</p>, <p>There are things that they can improve on – support for emoticons is the first to come to mind. One problem that they can’t overcome, but which users should be aware of, is that Meebo is taking (and can store) your IM usernames and password. Any Meebo employee (and hacker) with database access could obtain these credentials and use or change them. Something to be aware of.</p>, <p>Also, Meebo should be supporting Jabber even in this public alpha product. Jabber is an open protocol and should therefore be the easiest service to implement. By supporting Jabber, Meebo would allow you to access Google Talk (<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=175"">profile</a>) as well. This was pointed out in a comment by <a href=""http://www.webreakstuff.com/"">Frederico Oliveira</a> on an <a href=""http://www.uneasysilence.com/archive/2005/09/4182"">UneasySilence</a> post on Meebo earlier today.</p>, <p>For additional information, see the Meebo <a href=""http://blog.meebo.com/?page_id=2"">about us</a> page and <a href=""http://blog.meebo.com/"">blog</a>.</p>, <p>Elaine Wherry â€“ the Ajax guru<br/>

You can subscribe to podcasts, and listen to them via the site or download them to your computer or device. The key value-add is their recommendation engine – you rate media and get recommendations based on your ratings v. ratings by other community members (it works in the same way that Netflix recommends new movies to you).</p>, <p>In addition to substantial visual improvements, Loomia has added tagging of media, creating a great new way to find podcasts and videocasts of relevant content.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/loomia.png""/></p>, <p>Check out <a href=""http://www.loomia.com"">Loomia</a> – it’s free and it’s the best resource we know about for finding new podcasting and videocasting content.</p>]"
Editorial: On Mash-ups,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">Mash-ups, or the use of distinctive services for the creation of new and interesting applications, are one of the most interesting concepts behind the Web 2.0 phenomenon. Here on Techcrunch, we’re always up for the challenge of talking about innovation with services and apps, so we have decided to start covering Mash-ups more frequently.</p>, <p>What this means is that besides the profiles and articles you’re already used to reading on the site, we’ll be talking about the cool stuff people are building by combining the platforms companies like Google, Yahoo, Amazon, Ebay and everyone else are setting up. This is a fascinating field, in a quite fascinating era for computing.</p>, <p>This being said, and since we are always up to see what our readers are doing, feel free to send in comments or emails about what you find interesting about the Web 2.0, mashups, platform services or anything you believe fits on Techcrunch. We’re ready to listen to what you have to say, and we’re definitely up to seeing what cool projects and products you are all working on.</p>]"
Netvibes – Personal homepage,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""netvibes"" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/netvibes.jpg""/> Netvibes, a project started in France by Florant Fremont, is the latest web-app based on the idea of personalized homepages and like some others (like <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/08/03/profile-msn-startcom/"">Start</a> and <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=104"">Google’s personal homepage</a>), it is powered by some nicely developed Ajax. Their goal is best put in their own words, so quoting their <a href=""http://www.netvibes.com/blog/?2005/09/08/2-netvibes-is-released"">blog post</a> about the launch on the 8th september,</p>, <p>The aim of it is to provide a place on the internet where you can set just the content you like, a super easy way of building your personnalized homepage, available anywhere, anytime. No registration is needed, however if you want to access your page from another computer you’ll be able to do it by registering with your email address and a password.</p>, <p>The project itself looks pretty good: modules are intuitive and the page interaction’s easy to catch up on with just a few seconds. There are a few other things on the slate too, apparently, like modules for Flickr, feed searching, bookmarks, etc (a proper list is available on <a href=""http://www.netvibes.com/blog/"">their blog</a>). All in all, while it is another solution for a problem that many people are tackling, Netvibes looks like a pretty good Ajax-based homepage, so you should <a href=""http://www.netvibes.com"">definitely check it out</a> and take your conclusions.</p>, <p>Ed. note: And it’s nice to see Techcrunch as one of the default feeds too.

Also, it is great to see the Odeo guys aren’t sitting down and keep working on cool stuff that us podcasting aficionados can use. Great!</p>]"
Pluck Expands Product Line,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.pluck.com"">Pluck</a> (<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=89"">previous</a> <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/08/11/update-pluck-new-product-releases/"">profiles</a>) is quietly building a very nice suite of web 2.0 products (see <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=92"">Shadows</a> as well).</p>, <p>They <a href=""http://www.pluck.com/press/PluckPR-050909-InSite.html"">announced two new products</a> on September 12 – InSite RSS and InSite Blogging. Both products are aimed at online content publishers, particularly online newspapers. Both can generate significant revenue for Pluck, as they charge for these services. Pluck also announced their first customer for these products.</p>, <p>I spoke with Dave Panos, the CEO of Pluck, via email about these products and their first customer deal.</p>, <p>InSite RSS is a tool to allow sites to integrate RSS feed content directly into their websites, adding significant stickiness to their users.</p>, <p><strong>InSite RSS:</strong> Allows publishers to provide their readers with personalized news services that leverage millions of available RSS feeds. With InSite RSS, portals can deliver a “My News” style offering, giving users control over feed discovery, subscription and consumption. InSite RSS keeps sites on par with major web portals and ensures that all feed source providers are referenced and linked to appropriately. InSite RSS leverages Pluck’s award-winning consumer RSS technology and Pluck’s FeedFinder service for RSS feed discovery.</p>, <p>With InSite Blogging, site users/readers can create their own blogs. For sites with a local focus, like online newspapers, this can be a very effective tool for adding stickiness, as well as increasing content creation on local issues. While editorial control can be an issue (as the LA Times found out quite painfully), this can be a way for newspapers with an online presence to stop the customer bleeding they’ve had to suffer over the years.</p>, <p><strong>InSite Blogging:</strong> A hosted, managed solution that enables publishers to offer community blogging as part of their web sites. The service allows publishers and web portals to offer readers a fully-featured citizen journalism program complete with photos, community tools, tagging, categorization, management and reporting. Once embedded into a web site, the service opens new sources of content and contextual advertising space while building reader loyalty and page views. InSite Blogging is built on technology Pluck acquired earlier in 2005 from EasyJournal, a third-generation community of hundreds of thousands of active bloggers.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Pluck also announced their first customer for Insite Blogging – The Austin American-Statesman, a Cox newspaper and Central Texas’ leading daily newspaper (it basically owns Austin).</p>, <p>The blogging sites can be seen <a href=""http://www.statesmanblogs.com"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.austin360blogs.com"">here</a>.

They’ve also announced that Flock will be publicly available sometime in October:</p>, <p>We’re going to be phasing out our online breadcrumb service and replacing it with a couple more… established options. Oh, and don’t worry, we’ll make sure you can take your existing breadcrumbs with you. So in the meantime, keep posting to our service, but know that we’ll be shutting its doors come November 1. Questions? Just let us know.</p>, <p>So back to the next release. Let me first say that we’re all very excited about the ideas we’re baking into Flock 0.5. Second, we’re set to launch something public in October! So between this Friday<br/>
and then, we’re going to need lots of intrepid testers to pound on our stuff and let us know what works, what’s broken, what you like and what you can’t stand.</p>, <p>I must say I’m even more impressed with Flock – it is a very bold move to simply drop functionality that must have hundreds of developer hours behind it. They are obviously serious about listening to beta feedback and building an exceptional product.</p>, <p>Chris also pointed to <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/foolswisdom/tags/flockworldhq/"">flickr pictures of the flock office and people</a> taken by Flocker Lloyd Budd.</p>]"

It uses ajax and flash intelligently. Integration is very simple (adding a javascript snippet into the blog template). It provides detailed analytics on every aspect of your blog – how readers get to your site, what they read, whether they comment and what links they use to leave.</p>, <p>We can’t post screen shots or feature comparisons yet, but I will say this: tools like Measure Map, <a href=""http://www.haveamint.com"">Mint</a>, and <a href=""http://www.feedburner.com"">Feedburner</a> that track blog analytics are extremely useful.</p>, <p>They take a much needed step past existing server log analyzers.

Memeorandum Is Exceptional,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">I’ve been using <a href=""http://tech.memeorandum.com"">Memeorandum</a> for about a month (since <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/08/19/event-bar-camp-day-1/"">Bar Camp</a> in August). Gabe Rivera, the creator, gave me a private demo and set up a demo site for me (no longer active). Like <a href=""http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/12.html#a11129"">Robert Scoble</a>, I was hooked immediately.</p>, <p>This is a HUGE thing to me. If you are a busy executive and only have five minutes a day to see what the blogs are saying, this is THE PLACE to come to every day.</p>, <p>Memeorandum is the result of <a href=""http://blog.memeorandum.com/050912/why-does-memeorandum-exist"">Gabe’s frustration</a> with tracking blogger conversations about a given topic. Search engine weren’t producing intelligent results, and links from blogs didn’t tell the full story. So like any good entrepreneur, he set out to tackle the problem. And boy did he come up with a compelling solution. It’s one of those sites you just keep coming back to, every day.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Memeorandum is a way to track blog conversations relating to <a href=""http://www.memeorandum.com"">political</a> or <a href=""http://tech.memeorandum.com"">tech</a> issues (Gabe can and probably will add additional verticals in the future) in a highly effective manner. When you go to the site you see what is being talked about the most in the blogsphere at that moment. The most highly linked articles appear at the top and in bigger font sizes. Less popular items are below. Super-popular items eventually are pushed down as newer popular stuff goes up.</p>, <p>Here’s how it works: A post is written. People start to link to it. If enough people link and it becomes very popular, it goes up in the “New Item Finder” area in the top right. If more people link, it will go up in the main area. If a link includes <em>conversation </em>and <em>discourse</em> (substantial text in addition to the link), the linking blog is noted underneath the popular post.</p>, <p>All of this is automated, which is the really beautiful part of the service.</p>, <p>Memeorandum is very low noise, too. It tracks about 2,000 blogs today – only content from those blogs comes up on the site. Yes, it’s a limitation, but it results in very relevant and high quality results.

Public loops can also be searched for and subscribed to from the site.</p>, <p>And multiple people can add pictures to a loop. And “With a simple click, frames can open to a zoom view, link to video, audio, ï¬‚ash, or directly to â€œclick to buy” or â€œbid” page on any website.

We try to make it easier to tell your story, share your worldview, and find others who are telling their stories.</p>, <p>Some people have mixed feelings about videoblogging. While some say it will never pick up, others say it’s going to be huge by the end of the year. <a href=""http://webreakstuff.com/"">Personally</a>, I believe it is a fascinating area, and anything that gives more power for people to publish their own video/audio/text materials in a decentralized way is a great thing.

Truveo – Video Search,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.truveo.com"">Truveo</a> is a video search engine that beta-launched a few days ago. Jeff Clavier, an investor, <a href=""http://blog.softtechvc.com/2005/09/truveo_the_litt.html"">writes about Truveo here</a>.</p>, <p>If you are looking for video content, this is the place to go.</p>, <p>Founded two years ago by a seriously <a href=""http://www.truveo.com/about.php?p=team"">smart team</a> of search experts, Truveo is tackling the very difficult problem of creating metadata from video out of whole cloth – unlike text-based content, it is very difficult to determine context of video and audio content without a human to actually view it (which is error prone and doesn’t scale).</p>, <p>Truveo takes an innvoative two step approach to indexing new content. The first step is a straight web crawl to find the videos. The second, more important step, is to create metadata about the content, beyond what is available in transcripts and feeds (most video content has neither). They’ve created a “<a href=""http://www.truveo.com/about.php"">visual crawler</a>” that looks at surrounding content to determine context.</p>, <p>Finding all the video files on the web is only part of the challenge. For video to be searchable, it is also necessary to collect meaningful text metadata to associate with each video file. Of course, we rely on standard techniques, such as mining closed-caption transcripts and importing RSS feeds. The vast majority of video on the web, however, does not have any closed-caption or RSS metadata available. Fortunately, our visual crawlers come to the rescue. Whenever our visual crawlers find a new video on the web, they can also “visually” examine the context of the surrounding web application. In most cases, this examination reveals a bounty of rich and detailed metadata related to every video.</p>, <p>With our unique approach to crawling, not only can we find the videos that the other crawlers miss, but we can also collect rich and relevant metadata for each video. As a result, when you search for video with Truveo, you can always find high-quality, relevant search results. The next time you are looking for a web video to watch, we invite you to try our search engine and see for yourself.</p>, <p>The best thing is, this stuff actually works. Try searches for <a href=""http://www.truveo.com/search.php?q=hurricane+rita&amp;akw=web+video"">Hurricane Rita</a> and <a href=""http://www.truveo.com/search.php?q=daily+show&amp;streaming+video"">Daily Show</a>.</p>, <p>There are <a href=""http://www.truveo.com/advancedSearch.php"">advanced search</a> options and <a href=""http://www.truveo.com/prefs.php?refpage=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.truveo.com%2Findex.php%3FfromPrefs%3D1"">preferences</a> that will assist users in finding relevant content. Sadly, the “adult filter” is turned on by default. :-) You can also filter out paid content.</p>, <p>The only thing I’d like to see added is RSS feeds for search.</p>, <p>Dr. Timothy Tuttle – CEO &amp; Founder<br/>

Mercedes-Benz CL-Class Offers Unparalleled Protection,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""mercedes.jpg"" class=""center"" src=""http://old.crunchgear.com/wp-content/uploads/mercedes.jpg""/></p>, <p>Motor Trend reports that the new Mercedes-Benz CL-Class features a new technology called Pre-Safe. Utilizing this new system, the cars are able to detect driving conditions that have a high probability of accident. When it senses that danger might be imminent, the sysem enacts a series of precautions designed to lessen the severity of the impact. By adjusting variables like seat height and open windows, the Pre-Safe system helps to move the driver and the passengers into positions that most successfully take advantage of safeguards like harnesses and airbags.</p>, <p>In addition to the standard Pre-Safe system, Mercedes-Benz will also be offering the Pre-Safe brake system. Working in conjunction with the Brake Assist Plus (BAS Plus) system that was introduced last year, the Pre-Safe brake addition takes a more proactive approach when facing impending doom. Where the BAS Plus simply alerted drivers to potential rear end collisions, then used radar to calculat the necessary braking pressure by the driver, the Pre-Safe brake system reacts directly to threatening stimuli. If, in the face of a perceived threat. the driver fails to engage the brake, the new system will automatically apply up to 40% of the braking power in order to avoid or lessen the wreck. <span id=""more-250""></span></p>, <p>These additions are definitely indicative of some clever goings on over at Mercedes-Benz, but I can’t help but wonder about the potential problems of this new brake system. The CL-Class are high performance vehicles. I suspect that in the name of speed and fun, drivers often knowingly put themselves into compromising driving conditions. There are more than a few situations that I can think where this brake could potentially cause the accidents it was created to avoid.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.motortrend.com/features/auto_news/2006/112_news060815_mercedes_benz_cl_class_pre_safe_system/index.html""><br/>

VideoEgg Launches,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.videoegg.com"">VideoEgg</a>, founded by three Yale graduates, launched at <a href=""http://www.demo.com/"">DEMO</a> in Huntington Beach, CA on Monday.</p>, <p>Given the light content on their website, my bet is that the folks at VideoEgg have been working quite hard over the last few weeks to get the product ready for release.</p>, <p>VideoEgg is a web-based publishing service that allows users to capture video content from virtually any device and format and publish it to the web. Click <a href=""http://www.videoegg.com/Player.html?timestamp=1127333563187"">here</a> for an example featuring <a href=""http://buzzmodo.typepad.com/buzznovation/"">Buzz Bruggeman</a>.</p>, <p>At first glance, VideoEgg has some really excellent features. A <a href=""http://www.videoegg.com/Publisher.html"">live demo</a> is available on their site, and allows you to drag a video into the viewer to get a taste for how easy it is to use. <a href=""http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash"">Flash 8</a> allows the viewing of videos with enhanced quality.</p>, <p>From their<a href=""http://www.videoegg.com/PressRelease091905.html""> launch press release</a>:</p>, <p>Today, VideoEgg, Inc. unveiled the VideoEgg Publisher, a new Web-based video publishing technology that makes it easy for everyday Internet users to capture, encode, upload, and watch online video for the first time. A ‘universal adapter’ that captures directly from hundreds of devices and reads dozens of formats, the VideoEgg Publisher allows users to painlessly publish video that anyone can watch without worrying about player compatibilities, encoding settings, or extra software. VideoEgg announced the Publisher at the DEMOfall 2005 Conference, the invitation only, leading industry showcase for launching innovative technology products.</p>, <p>Currently, posting video online is complicated for users, requiring a highly technical understanding of formats, encoders, players and servers. The VideoEgg Publisher simplifies the difficult video encoding and posting process, allowing users to capture video directly into a Website from camcorders, Web cams, and mobile phones. It also accepts video files via a simple drag-and-drop interface. Before movies are encoded and posted, users can perform basic edits with the Publisher’s simple editing tools.</p>, <p>Using this system, videos are immediately available for viewing online through the Flash-based VideoEgg Player, a “playerless” solution that does not require external players like Windows Media and QuickTime.</p>, <p>Lots of interesting information about the service above…and the last paragraph is really interesting. Publishers can easily integrate content directly on their website by simply adding a html snippet.</p>, <p>This is something I really like about VideoEgg – it appears that they are really focused on making their product as easy as possible to use.</p>, <p>I’ve downloaded their software (which seems to be off the site now) and am digging through a box for my video camera.

However, many users requested the ability to include RSS feeds of their choice directly into their blog and news channels. <a href=""http://www.findory.com/company/"">Greg and Alex</a> just <a href=""http://glinden.blogspot.com/2005/09/findory-rss-reader-part-ii.html"">added this functionality</a>, making Findory nearly perfect as a news source and reader.</p>, <p>Findory users now have the ability to add feeds directly into Findory – one at a time, via an OPML cut-and-paste or simply by directly importing your feeds from Bloglines, if that is your current reader. You can also import other users’ public Bloglines feeds.</p>, <p>Once you’ve imported these feeds, the powerful Findory personalization engine takes over and presents posts to you in a personalized way, based on what you (and community members like you) tend to find interesting.

When you set up your bookmark page on Del.icio.us, not only can you see the pages youâ€™ve you tagged, you can also see related articles from other people who tagged the same pages or used the same tags as you have. Since every Del.icio.us page has an RSS feed, you can also subscribe to feeds based on a given subject, user, URL, or tag.

When you tag articles with Attensa your bookmark list on Del.icio.us is updated and synchronized automatically. With the addition of tagging, Attensa gives you a set of tools for organizing your feeds and articles. Categories let you create a hierarchal structure using folders to keep feeds organized. Tags give you a more free form tool for keeping articles organized and they connect you with the del.icio.us social network.</p>, <p>Attensa is aggresively adding features to compete with other readers and has an excellent product suite.

JotSpot Live – The Perfect Wiki?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.jotlive.com"">JotSpot Live</a>, a <a href=""http://www.jot.com"">JotSpot</a> company, launched today. They’ve created an awesome wiki tool that solves at least two common wiki problems – the specialized markup language and multiple simultaneous users.</p>, <p>I love wikis. <a href=""http://wiki.beta.techcrunch.com/second_meetup_bbq?DokuWiki=c210498c23be0e7532702a418ef7a7d2"">We have one</a>. They are perfect for group collaboration.</p>, <p>But wiki code is different from everything else and while it isn’t difficult, it’s silly to have to use it (note<a href=""http://www.socialtext.com/weblog/050821wikiwyg.html""> Social Text’s wikiwyg</a>, however, which is a nice wysiwyg editor for wikis). And only one person can edit text at any one time.</p>, <p>Jotspot Live solves both of these problems. It also doesn’t require any server software. <u>It’s a dead simple wiki application.</u> With a few feature additions (like link and image support) it will be good enough for most people to use.</p>, <p>It’s built with Ruby on Rails and uses Ajax to allow dragging and dropping of text around the screen. Add users by adding their email address. The wiki has presence functionality, meaning it shows you who is live on the page at any time. Multiple users can edit text simultaneously.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.fettig.net/weblog/2005/07/08/jotspot-live/"">Abe Fettig</a>, who is one of the people who built JotSpot Live, writes this about it:</p>, <p>Iâ€™ve been working on a project at JotSpot that is so incredibly cool, I get excited every time I think about it. Itâ€™s called JotSpot Live.</p>, <p>JotSpot Live is a real-time wiki interface that allows multiple users to edit the same page at the same time. Calling it â€œSubEthaEdit for the web” is an oversimplification, but thatâ€™s probably the quickest way to wrap your head around the concept. Unlike SubEthaEdit, JotSpot Live doesnâ€™t require any special client software: itâ€™s a web application that runs in Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari, using nothing but HTML, script, and CSS.</p>, <p>It’s not perfect. <a href=""http://solutionwatch.com"">Brian Benzinger</a> (who also writes about <a href=""http://www.solutionwatch.com/238/jotspot-live-live-group-note-taking-in-real-time/"">JotSpot Live here</a>) and I are editing a page right now and he’s found a bug that occurs when two users simultaneously  edit text. We also noticed that if one person logs off and then back on, two separate versions of the wiki page seem to run and each person only sees themself as “present”.</p>, <p>Other problems: Slow load time, no image support, it doesn’t tell you who written or edited text, there is no page delete function and you can’t uninvite people once they are added.</p>, <p>However, all of these bugs/feature adds are easily fixed.</p>, <p>Fred Oliveira (TechCrunch editor) <a href=""http://webreakstuff.com/blog/2005/07/collaborative-editing-solutions-almost-none/"">wrote a post on webreakstuff</a> about problems with wikis and collaborative software in general in July 2005. He identified many of the problems that JotSpot Live addresses.</p>, <p>Free for up to five wiki pages per month. Includes advertising.</p>, <p>$5/month for up to 15 pages per month. No ads.</p>, <p>$20/month for unlimited pages. No ads.</p>, <p>There are no restrictions on functionality or number of users.</p>, <p>Joe Kraus, co-founder and CEO<br/>

<a href=""http://www.rollyo.com"">Rollyo</a>, which launched today, allows you to create and publish your own search engines, based on websites you decide to include. <a href=""http://battellemedia.com/archives/001893.php"">John Battelle</a> and <a href=""http://www.micropersuasion.com/2005/09/roll_your_own_s.html"">Steve Rubel</a> wrote about Rollyo earlier today as well.</p>, <p>The basic idea? Create customized searches (built on Yahoo search) that include only those sites you want to include. Search those sites for information that you know you can trust. And, see what other’s have created, and leverage those searches as well.</p>, <p>To set up (or “roll”) a search, you are asked to name up to 20 websites, pick a category and tag the search. A search can be public or private – public searches are ranked by popularity and listed on the site. You can also share searches with others directly.</p>, <p>Once you search, you can also expand the search out to all websites to get additional results.</p>, <p>In their <a href=""http://www.rollyo.com/about.html"">About</a> section, Rollyo says:</p>, <p><strong>Rollyo is the fast, easy way to create personal search engines using only the sources you trust.<br/>
</strong><br/>
Are you tired of wading though thousands of irrelevant search results to get to the information you want? Ever wish you could narrow your search to sites you already know and trust? With Rollyo, you can easily create your own custom search engines, and explore and save those created by others.</p>, <p><strong>WHY ROLLYO?</strong></p>, <p>Rollyo puts the power of Yahoo! Search in your hands, by giving you the tools to create your own personal search engines – with no programming required. All you have to do is pick the sites you want to search, and we’ll create a custom search engine for you.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.davenetics.com/"">Dave Pell</a>, Founder + Roll Player<br/>

After seeing slide in action, though, I actually liked it.</p>, <p>Slide allows you to subscribe to content feeds by selected publishers or by your friends. This means that slide can become a useful tool on the job if you need to monitor graphical data, or it can be fun with your family if you want to keep watching new pictures from your loved ones. Me, I prefer the first. Initially I thought of a couple of applications, like monitoring webcams, graphical data or watching other kind of dataset that can be expressed through pictures. Then there’s the novelty uses like delivering music to selected people, etc.</p>, <p>All in all, even if you don’t like when things take some desktop space, you may find some of Slide’s capabilities interesting enough to give it a try, so go download it and try it for yourself.</p>, <p>I almost forgot that there’s now a TechCrunch channel for Slide, so if you want to subscribe to it, <a href=""http://techcrunch.slide.com/"">click here</a> and the Slide guys will take care of the rest for you. Sadly at the time of this writing there’s no MacOSX version so I can run it on my own machine, but we have it running on our demos machine in the living room. Nicely done!</p>]"

Each of the items in the directory is an article on TechCrunch. I wanted to include his content in mine because I would point to every review he writes, they’re all on-topic for Scripting News readers.</p>, <p>When he makes a change to that directory, the <a href=""http://www.thetwowayweb.com/stories/storyReader$2070"">box</a> recalcs. When it appears on <a href=""http://www.scripting.com/"">www.scripting.com</a> tomorrow, it will recalc every time I update Scripting News (that page is statically rendered). If you want you can include Mike’s directory in your site, or in your directory through inclusion. It’s a normal OPML file, edited with the OPML Editor.</p>, <p>This is, in so many ways, the kind of collaboration I envisioned when I released the OPML Editor. Mike, a lawyer who loves technology, is exactly the kind of person I want to empower with OPML.</p>, <p>This is just a start. We’re working on the taxonomy and interface.

More because they monitor sites not covered by existing prospective search engines (including pages without feeds) and because they offer much more tailored searches (language and country filters, more keyword inclusion/exclusion functionality, etc. Less because they search only 25,000 blogs, whereas blog search engines generally hit the entire blogosphere (tens of millions of blogs).</p>, <p>However, CustomScoop, like <a href=""http://tech.memeorandum.com"">Memeorandum</a> (<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/09/18/memeorandum-is-exceptional/"">profile</a>), carefully chooses what they consider to be the most important blogs that will supply their customers with pertinent information.</p>, <p>In addition to the 25,000 blogs, CustomScoop also monitors U.S. Online News (5,000 sources),  International Online News (2,000 sources), US &amp; EU Government Web Sites (7,000 sources) and Policy Web Sites (1,200 sources).</p>, <p>Search results, as they come in, can be viewed via RSS, twice daily emails or on the CustomScoop website.

1-800-Free-411: Free Directory Calls,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">Directory assistance calls are expensive – $1 and higher – and yet 6 billion of them are made every year in the U.S. <a href=""http://www.free411.com/index.htm"">1-800-free-411</a> is a new and brilliant service from Jingle Networks that provides this service to consumers for free.</p>, <p><strong>1-800-FREE411 was created to provide callers with a free alternative to the skyrocketing rates being charged by phone companies for directory assistance (411).<br/>
</strong><br/>
The service is made possible by thousands of national and local businesses who sponsor this service with brief valuable audio advertisements that are played to callers who request businesses  in their yellow pages category.  This advertising model allows businesses to acquire new customers over the phone, cost effectively, with little or no risk.  Meanwhile callers get free directory assistance, potentially saving each of them thousand of dollars per year.</p>, <p>The company was founded by veteran advertising and technology executives who pioneered some of the most innovative and successful advertising solutions in online media and now they are opening yet another channel for businesses to acquire new customers. This time, it’s over the phone.</p>, <p>The service works mostly like normal directory assistance. You dial their phone number and go through an automated system that asks for the location, type of listing and listing name. While you are waiting for the number, you must listen to a 12 second advertisement from a competitor to the service.

iKarma has Potential to Be Huge,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.ikarma.com"">iKarma</a> is an online feedback and reputation system that we’ve been kicking the tires on for a few days.</p>, <p>While there are many closed, centralized feedback services that are quite useful (ebay’s feedback, for instance), they are a part of the service they support and cannot be leveraged effectively outside of those services.</p>, <p>I think they may be on to something really big here, but in my humble opinion they need to embrace the ideas of open services and open data. If they do that, I can see important third party applications being built on the back of iKarma. I expand on this below under “What it Needs”.</p>, <p>You can register for iKarma directly at their site or via an email from someone who would like to write about you. Once you’ve registered you get an initial five-star review from the iKarma team and are encouraged to add contacts and begin writing about people. If they aren’t members, you can invite them.</p>, <p>A review consists of a star rating (0-5) and a free-text area. Your overall star rating is averaged among all reviews. If <a href=""http://www.ikarma.com/faq.asp?MainShow=5&amp;userid=7954#7"">you don’t like a review</a>, you can leave a comment with an explanation or choose to start a more formal challenge process.</p>, <p>You can only leave a review for any given member once; however, you can edit all aspects of a review if you change your mind later.</p>, <p>The basic service is free and iKarma <a href=""http://www.ikarma.com/faq.asp?MainShow=5&amp;userid=7954#7"">plans </a>to roll out paid premium services in the future.</p>, <p>To see our iKarma profile, click the icon below, or <a href=""http://techcrunch.ikarma.com"">here</a>.</p>, <p><a href=""http://techcrunch.ikarma.com/"" target=""_new""><br/>
<img border=""0"" src=""http://techcrunch.ikarma.com/seals/sealcolors08_150x45.jpg""/></a></p>, <p>iKarma does one thing, reputation, very well. It has a clean and usable interface and no bugs were found. I also like that comments can be edited later on if the author changes her or his mind.</p>, <p>eBay has certainty that two parties have done business because they (eBay) close transactions and know who both parties are. A necessary limitation of the iKarma is that they have no idea if someone posting a review actually knows or has transacted with the person they are writing about. iKarma has mitigated this problem somewhat by creating a formal challenge process to any posted review.</p>, <p>I really like the point system in eBay. There is no upper limit on total feedback and I believe people use eBay sometimes simply because they want to increase their overall feedback number. In contrast, the only objective measure of your iKarma is an average star rating. After a certain critical mass is built up, another postive review or two will not noticeably affect your score. I think iKarma (for business reasons) should change their system to create a points system similar to eBay.</p>, <p>iKarma has an icon that you can include on a website or email (we’ve put one above). However, the icon would be more useful if it also told viewers your total iKarma score.</p>, <p>Lastly, and most importantly, there are many new web 2.0 and other online applications that could deeply embrace a third party reputation system like iKarma’s. But for that embrace to happen, they are going to have to <u>open up their data and their APIs and let people create mashups</u>.</p>, <p>I’m betting iKarma is hard at work building premium features to generate revenue. If I was running the company, I’d raise capital now (I don’t think they have), stop building premium features and focus entirely on opening up the APIs and data for third party applications.

24 Hour Laundry Launches as Ning,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>24 Hour Laundry launched moments ago as <a href=""http://www.ning.com/"">Ning</a>. We’re profiling now.</p>]"
Ning launches!,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.ning.com"">Ning</a>, also known as the official name for <a href=""http://24hourlaundry.com"">24 Hour Laundry</a>‘s project, just launched. I actually had to keep myself from posting early because I was excited about it. Now that I got the word from them with the approval to post, here goes the unveiling.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.ning.com"">Ning</a> is, and I quote, “a free online service (or, as we like to call it, a Playground) for building and using social applications. Social apps are web applications that enable anyone to match, transact, and communicate with other people”.</p>, <p><img alt=""Ning"" class=""shot"" src=""/wp-content/ning.gif""/>So, what does this mean for the global audience? A whole lot. It means anyone can now get their ideas out there and build a project (some people would call it a <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/category/mash-ups/"">mash-up</a>) in a few clicks, with no developer experience. And if you are a developer, you can pop under the hood and change it to your liking, no questions asked.</p>, <p>The reason why I’m excited about it is simple: allowing people to build cool new stuff that they normally wouldn’t (empowering the users) is one of the best things you can do on the Web 2.0 space. If you think about it, back when blogging started it was also about allowing people to do things they weren’t able to before – publish content online. This is it, all over again, but instead of blogs, you get to build cool apps.</p>, <p>This being said, get out there and try it. And we at TechCrunch definitely want to see what you come up with too, so drop us a note if you’re using Ning to build cool stuff. To the 24 Hour Laundry guys: congratulations for the launch!</p>]"

Welcome to Web 3.0: Now Your Other Computer is a Data Center,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/marc-benioff""><img class=""shot2"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/marcb.jpg""/></a><em>This guest post is written by <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/marc-benioff"">Marc Benioff</a>, chairman and CEO of <a href=""http://www.salesforce.com"">salesforce.com</a>. He has been widely recognized for pioneering innovation with honors such as the 2007 Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year, the SDForum Visionary Award, Alumni Entrepreneur of the Year by the University of Southern California (USC) Marshall School of Business, and being ranked No. 7 on the Top 100 Most Influential People in IT survey by eWEEK.</em></p>, <p>For almost ten years now, we have been witnessing a decisive shift from client-server software to software as a service. Google, eBay, and Amazon.com established the value of multi-tenant internet applications in the consumer market, and salesforce.com, Google, and others have been proving that this same multi-tenant model is winning in the enterprise as well.</p>, <p>This shift to Web-based applications has generated two powerful waves so far. Now, we are seeing a third wave—one that we are calling Web 3.0—and it may prove to be the most significant and disruptive yet to the traditional software industry.</p>, <p>While the world doesn’t need another buzzword, I feel that both the emerging generation of entrepreneurs and developers, as well as traditional software ISVs, need to grasp the enormity of Web 3.0 and its potential to create change, disruption, and opportunity. Web 3.0 is about replacing existing software platforms with a new generation of platforms as a service.</p>, <p>To put Web 3.0 into perspective, we need to look at all of the major waves in the history of the Web. They are not defined by distinct periods of time, but are best seen as overlapping waves of adoption.</p>, <p><strong>Web 1.0: Anyone Can Transact</strong><br/>
Web 1.0 was about the emergence of the “killer app” from companies like eBay, Amazon.com, and Google. Although we thought of them as Web sites at the time, they were really amazing applications with a level of functionality, ease of use, and scale that had rarely been seen before by the average consumer. Transactions, not just of goods but of knowledge, became ubiquitous and instant. The efficiency and transparency that was once the domain of global financial markets was now at the command of individual consumers and businesses. Web 1.0 remains a huge driving force today and will continue to be for some time.</p>, <p><strong>Web 2.0: Anyone Can Participate</strong><br/>
Web 2.0 is about the next generation of applications on the Internet, featuring user-generated content, collaboration, and community. Anyone can participate in content creation. Posting a viral video on YouTube, tagging photos from a party on Flickr, or writing about politics on Blogspot requires no technical skill, just an Internet connection. Participation changes our idea of content itself: content isn’t fixed at the point of publication—it comes alive. Google’s AdSense became an instant business model in particular for bloggers, and video-sharing sites have rewritten the rules of popular culture and viral content.</p>, <p>Whether you are creating a business around Web 1.0 or 2.0, building massively scalable data centers that are secure, reliable, and highly available is not a job for the faint of heart or shallow of pocket. For companies entering the emerging software as a service industry, the massive time and capital requirements remain a substantial barrier to entry. Moreover, traditional client-server software development is still mired in painful complexity. And the “rewards” for creating a successful application are arduous deployments and maintenance.</p>, <p><strong>Web 3.0: Anyone Can Innovate</strong><br/>
Web 3.0 changes all of this by completely disrupting the technology and economics of the traditional software industry. The new rallying cry of Web 3.0 is that anyone can innovate, anywhere. Code is written, collaborated on, debugged, tested, deployed, and run in the cloud. When innovation is untethered from the time and capital constraints of infrastructure, it can truly flourish.</p>, <p>For businesses, Web 3.0 means that SaaS apps can be developed, deployed, and evolved far more quickly and cost-effectively than traditional software of the client-server era. The dramatic reset in economics should help CIOs finally break through the innovation backlog created by the cost and complexity of maintaining client-server apps.</p>, <p>For developers, Web 3.0 means that all they need to create their dream app is an idea, a browser, some Red Bull, and a few Hot Pockets. Because every developer around the world can access the same powerful cloud infrastructures, Web 3.0 is a force for global economic empowerment.</p>, <p>For ISVs, Web 3.0 means that they can spend more time focusing on the core value they want to offer to customers, not the infrastructure to support it. Because code lives in the cloud, global talent pools can contribute to it. Because it runs in the cloud, a truly global market can subscribe to it as a service.</p>, <p>Just ask my friend <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jeremy-roche"">Jeremy Roche</a>, the CEO of CODA, Europe’s second-largest ERP vendor.  CODA successfully navigated the transition from mainframe to client-server, and now it’s facing an even bigger transition to SaaS. Building the infrastructure—not just the data center but the entire software stack as well—would take upwards and $20 million and several years. Instead, Jeremy is using our Force.com platform to get a massive jump-start on this process. His systems engineers will not have to cobble together servers, load balancers, and networking switches and then find a small army of people to tune and maintain them. His software developers won’t have to build a security and sharing model, database or workflow engine—they’ll just use ours. Meanwhile, Jeremy’s team can focus on exactly what they do best: building a killer accounting application. CODA2go will be available this fall, giving Jeremy a big lead on the competition.</p>, <p>Amazon.com, Google, and salesforce.com have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build these infrastructures already, and a dozen others, including Facebook, MySpace, Ning, Rollbase, Longjump, Dabble db, Intuit, and Coghead, are also offering some form of platform as a service in the cloud.</p>, <p><strong>Creating Value</strong><br/>
How much disruption will Web 3.0 cause? An examination of the technology forces at work gives us a good clue:</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/vic-gundotra"">Vic Gundotra</a>, VP of Engineering at Google, offered this interesting perspective at a recent salesforce.com event. Vic looks at the history of computing, starting with the mainframe era, as two grids: vast computing power vs. low accessibility and terrific ease of deployment vs. poor depth of functionality.</p>, <p><img src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/graph1.jpg""/></p>, <p>The client-server era caused a reversal of polarity in both cases. Computing power was much more accessible but limited in scope; there was an explosion in functionality, but deployment became a nightmare. Vic sees the Web 3.0 era eliminating these trade-offs and potentially maximizing computing power, access, ease of deployment, and depth of functionality. As Vic says, the key is that industry leaders like Google, salesforce.com, and others have to work to make the cloud ever more accessible and programmable, keep connectivity pervasive, and make the client more powerful.</p>, <p>In our view, the move from mainframes to client server was painful for IBM and DEC and created massive wealth for a broad generation of new companies like Microsoft, Oracle, PeopleSoft, and SAP. Web 3.0 threatens Microsoft’s .net, BEA, and WebSphere. And while I expect companies such as Amazon.com, Facebook, Google, and salesforce.com to do well, I think that even more wealth and further innovation will be created by a new, more broadly distributed class of companies and entrepreneurs that leverage the power of Web 3.0.</p>, <p>One of our developers has a bumper sticker on his laptop that captures the spirit of Web 3.0 perfectly. It reads: “My other computer is a data center.” That’s a claim that any developer in the world can now make. And that’s the stuff of revolution.</p>]"

"Google Reader – Beautiful, Needs Work","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Google <a href=""http://www.google.com/press/annc/reader_launch.html"">launched </a> a web-based<a href=""http://www.google.com/reader""> ajax RSS reader</a> yesterday at Web2.0. The coverage saturated <a href=""http://tech.memeorandum.com/051007/p42#a051007p42"">Memeorandum</a>.</p>, <p>Unlike Bloglines, which uses frames to avoid page refreshes, Google Reader uses Ajax. The reader is visually stunning and at first glance appeared to be a contender. However, upon further review we’ve found what we consider to be some serious structural flaws.</p>, <p>The reader loads quickly and uses your stored gmail credentials to sign you in. Adding feeds is fairly easy via opml upload (which we did) or using the search bar. As you add feeds you have the option of adding tags (called “labels”). Individual posts are listed on the left – clicking on a post brings up the content in the view box on the right.</p>, <p>Google Reader is actually Google’s second RSS reader. See <a href=""http://"">Google IG</a> as well, which Google launched in late July. Unlike Google IG, which targets light RSS users who only read a few feeds, their new reader is targeted at those who want to move through a lot of feeds quickly.</p>, <p>There are a lot of positive features.</p>, <p>The reader uses ajax quite effectively to avoid page refreshes and to create a great visual experience.</p>, <p>Feeds can be tagged, and individual posts can be kept unread and starred.</p>, <p>The search functionality is excellent, and adding feeds requires no knowledge of RSS, opml or XML. It’s all automatic. Search only pulls up feeds you aren’t already subscribed to.</p>, <p>As I mentioned above, Google Reader is targeting heavy RSS readers. The product isn’t useful, however, for moving through a large number of feeds efficiently.</p>, <p>Posts are listed in order of “relevance” (which doesn’t seem to actually sort things in any relevant way), or by date. I need posts to be grouped under the individual blog because I read some feeds first – Google Reader doesn’t allow me to do this and I am frustrated trying to find the authors I like to read the most. There is no search functionality within feeds already subscribed to, so there is no way to find this content.</p>, <p>The reader is slow. Paging down through posts results in a long and unacceptable delay. As a side note, importing my OPML list took about 10 minutes. Since this was a one-time cost, it’s not that big of a deal.</p>, <p>Since this is a web-based reader only, there is no syncronization.</p>, <p>Google uses ajax instead of frames. While frames is an old technology, readers using it allow for multiple scroll bars – this means you can keep the feed frames locked while scrolling through individual posts. This needs to be addressed.</p>, <p>There is no unsubscribe button for feeds.</p>, <p>Google Reader is optimized for Firefox. It isn’t working properly on other browsers yet.</p>, <p>Many of the feature limitations can be addressed, but Google Reader has a long way to go if it is going to seriously threaten existing heavy-duty RSS readers. <a href=""http://rss.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000663062331/"">Brad Hill</a> also posts a lengthy review of Google Reader.</p>]"

Shayne Sweeney is the developer who’s building <a href=""http://www.gada.be"">Gada</a>.</p>, <p>Gada takes a query and runs it against sites like Google News, Technorati, Flickr, IceRocket, Amazon, Wikipedia, 43Things, etc. Searches can be narrowed via a drop down box to “photos”, “social” etc. for more specific results. The search itself, and any narrowing, are also accompished via the domain name. For instance, a photo search for “web2con”, the tag people are using for last week’s web2.0 conference, is also accomplished by the URL <a href=""http://web2con.gada.be/p"">web2con.gada.be/p</a>. The query is the subdomain, and the photo filter is the /p at the end.</p>, <p>Allowing easy searches <u>and</u> filtering via the domain name structure is brilliant, and allows for very powerful mobile searches. Note also that the name “Gada” is extremely easy to type on a phone’s number pad.</p>, <p> It was borne out of several frustrations. If you’ve ever tried to visit a Web site over a mobile device, you know it’s a pain in the knuckle. The domain had to be simple to key-in from anywhere. gada.be is 4232.2233 on most cell phones and PSPs. Normally, when you want to find something online, you have to choose a Web site (wait for the page to load) enter the query (wait for the second page to load) then see results from that provider. With “gada.be,” you insert the query *AS* the subdomain!</p>, <p>Then, there’s having to visit several sites just to get the results you want. Often, this isn’t feasible when you’re on-the-go. Even when you’re sitting with a laptop or chained to a desktop, it’s still a time-consuming process. We all love the individual search services, so why not bring ’em together? Okay, that’s what we did. Moreover, we dynamically output OPML which you can turn around and import into your favorite news aggregator. gada.be saves everybody time!</p>, <p>It’s likely that Gada will become a much-linked to site for definitive results on a term, in a similar way as wikipedia is today. Gada incorporates all relevant information in a permanent URL, and so becomes a comprehensive result set for a tag link. Gada also outputs search results in RSS and OPML, allowing users to easily subscribe to and organize searches.</p>, <p>More on Gada on their <a href=""http://gada.be/about"">about page</a>.</p>]"
Google Reader – Was I Too Quick to Criticize?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/08/google-reader-beautiful-needs-work/"">We wrote about </a><a href=""http://www.google.com/reader"">Google Reader</a> over the weekend and gave what I felt was a factually correct review of the product. However, some of the comments I’ve received to the post, along with a couple of emails, suggested some of my criticisms were off the mark. I took another look today and I must say that I was dead wrong on a few points.</p>, <p>I’ve copied my “areas to improve on” below and have bolded text that was incorrect:</p>, <p>As I mentioned above, Google Reader is targeting heavy RSS readers. The product isnâ€™t useful, however, for moving through a large number of feeds efficiently.</p>, <p>Posts are listed in order of â€œrelevanceâ€ (which doesnâ€™t seem to actually sort things in any relevant way), or by date. <strong>I need posts to be grouped under the individual blog because I read some feeds first – Google Reader doesnâ€™t allow me to do this and I am frustrated trying to find the authors I like to read the most.</strong> <strong>There is no search functionality within feeds already subscribed to, so there is no way to find this content.</strong></p>, <p>The reader is slow. Paging down through posts results in a long and unacceptable delay. As a side note, importing my OPML list took about 10 minutes. Since this was a one-time cost, itâ€™s not that big of a deal.</p>, <p>Since this is a web-based reader only, there is no syncronization.</p>, <p>Google uses ajax instead of frames. While frames is an old technology, readers using it allow for multiple scroll bars – this means you can keep the feed frames locked while scrolling through individual posts. This needs to be addressed.</p>, <p><strong>There is no unsubscribe button for feeds.</strong></p>, <p>Google Reader is optimized for Firefox. It isnâ€™t working properly on other browsers yet.</p>, <p>The three innacuracies were:</p>, <p>A quick look at the “My Subscriptions” link that is prominently displayed at the top of the reader shows that all of this functionality is included, and actually works quite well.</p>, <p>Under this tab, feeds are shown, can be sorted (second circle below), can be deleted, and, perhaps most importantly, can be searched (third circle) using the “filter” feature. Clicking on any particular feed brings up the related posts in the bottom window. It’s actually a very nice intuitive UI.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/googlereader2.jpg""/></p>, <p>Google Reader is still painfully slow, but these features, which I previously missed, do much to make it a competitive product. In my opinion, the “my subscriptions” tab should optionally be the home page, reducing the necessary clicks to get there.</p>]"
Yahoo Blog Search Launched,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Yahoo <a href=""http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000198.html"">released</a> a <a href=""http://news.search.yahoo.com/"">blog search product</a> tonight at 7 pm. <a href=""http://battellemedia.com/archives/001926.php"">John Battelle</a> had the scoop.</p>, <p>Unlike their podcasting product, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/09/yahoo-launches-major-podcasting-service/"">released last night</a>, the blog search product is not much more than a quick add-on to Yahoo News. Frankly, I am more than disappointed.</p>, <p>Instead of launching a stand alone property, Yahoo has integrated blog search into Yahoo News. Blog search results are presented on the right side of normal results, in a side-bar type area. For an example, see <a href=""http://news.search.yahoo.com/news/search?fr=sfp&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;p=web+2.0"">this search on “Web 2.0”</a>.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/yahooblogsearch.jpg""/></p>, <p>I’ve inserted a big red arrow and blew up the image to more than twice the size we normally use so that you can actually see the results in the right area of the page.</p>, <p>Yahoo has also integrated Flickr and My Web 2.0 results. It’s unclear how relevant the results are but at first glance there is significant room for improvement. I am finding the UI completely unusable.</p>]"
The Web 2.0 WorkGroup,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>There are a number of weblogs that I read religiously – of the 400+ feeds that I read, there are 15 or so that I check multiple times a day for new content.</p>, <p>Two of those blogs are Richard MacManus’ <a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/002880.php"">ReadWriteWeb</a> and Fred Oliveira’s <a href=""http://webreakstuff.com/blog/2005/10/web-20-workgroup-launches/"">WeBreakStuff</a>.</p>, <p>Richard and Fred write blogs that are very complimentary to TechCrunch. While we generally focus on new companies, Richard analyzes trends in the new web and Fred focuses on design, usability and development. To get an overall view of the space, I highly recommend reading all three blogs.</p>, <p>Today we’ve formed a loose alliance.

On that page we have links to all three blogs, along with recent posts and our feed information.</p>, <p>We will be adding additional blogs over time. This is not a blog network or anything formal. We just like the idea of coordinating our ideas a little more closely.</p>, <p>Richard and Fred have also become good friends. Richard, who’s from New Zealand, has come to the U.S. for the first time to attend the Web 2.0 conference last week, and he’s been staying at my house while he’s here.

Wink – People Powered Search,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.wink.com"">Wink</a> gave a brief <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/05/the-companies-of-web-20-part-2/"">demo at at Web2.0 last week</a> and we were immediately hooked. Wink is still in private beta (you can request an account on their home page), but I’ve had a chance to talk with CEO Michael Tanne and I’ve been using it all week.</p>, <p>At its core Wink is a search engine, and they’ve intelligently layered in shared user participation to give fresh, meaningful results that, Wink argues, can’t be found anywhere else. The key user participation features are tagging, rating and sharing.</p>, <p>Our goal at Wink is to combine search with user participation to give you fresher, more accurate, spam-free search.  You can create tags, rate results and keep track of sites you’ve visited.  You can create Search Sets of tags that show your expertise in a subject, and you can make those publicly available to be shared with other people.  Wink also has concepts that are created and updated by users like you, so feel free to edit existing concepts, or even write your own!</p>, <p>Because Wink is “people-powered”, it will only get better when people tag, rate, and share.  So please make Wink your default search engine, use it everyday, and let us know how you like it. And if you help us out by contributing or giving us feedback, we’ll give you some invitations of your own to send out!</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Core search results are provided by Google and wikipedia. A search query returns those results, which you can tag and rate from 0-5 stars. A zero rating help to block out spam and other bad content, eventually removing it from the index altogether.</p>, <p>This user-created metadata (when aggregated) helps Wink return more relevant results to the entire community. Wink has taken del.icio.us bookmark data to fill out their results with rich tagging content right from the start.</p>, <p>For future queries, tagged/rated results appear above normal search results.</p>, <p>Also within search results is an area where Wink users are listed that have tagged results with the query used. Clicking on any user takes you to a page that shows all of their public tags and ratings. If you find that you like a user’s tags and ratings, you can subscribe to those results via RSS.</p>, <p>There are a ton of other features as well that I am discovering as I use the service. For instance, you can create a “search set” (it reminds me of <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/09/28/rollyo-search-launches-today/"">Rollyo</a>) that combines links to favorite sites along with tags.</p>, <p>As a side note, people are realizing that user-generated metadata may be the key to improving search results. Google has taken early steps in this direction with their early bookmarking product. In our <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/11/google-bookmarks-tagging-launches/"">profile yesterday</a>, one of the <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/11/google-bookmarks-tagging-launches/#comment-1469"">comments opined</a> that Google may be experimenting in this area. Perfect timing for Wink!</p>]"
Measure Map To Launch by Year End,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Jeffrey Veen of Adaptive Path <a href=""http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000799.html"">writes</a> about <a href=""http://www.measuremap.com"">Measure Map</a> for the first time today.</p>, <p>Measure Map is an incredibly easy to use flash and ajax application that monitors blog traffic and analytics in many, many different ways. You can slice data almost every way imaginable. I’ll do a full review as soon as I have their permission.</p>, <p>In his post, Jeffrey provides a <a href=""http://static.flickr.com/30/51884282_59e31f907c_m.jpg"">screen shot</a> of the dashboard of the application, the first to appear publicly on the web. I took this as permission to post my own screen shot to the left.</p>, <p>They have not finalized pricing, but my understanding is it may be free for everything except real-time data. Jeffrey also says that the application should be launched by end of year. If you want to try it out sooner, request a beta account at their <a href=""http://www.measuremap.com"">site</a>.</p>, <p>Here is our quick pitch: Measure Map is a Web application that helps people get to know their blogs. We do this by collecting and analyzing blog-specific traffic statistics and presenting them in a browsable interface that encourages exploration. It is an experience that offers meaningful insight into the effects caused by small changes in how you blog, rather than the overwhelming complexity of most web stats tools with their query/report-style analytic methods. Measure Map provides understanding by refocusing the difficult problem of web statistics and solving it just for blogs.</p>, <p>We do this with a few lines of code in your blog’s template; there’s hardly any configuration to worry about. We collect your traffic data continuously and in real time and display it through some innovative Ajax-based techniques. But even though we’re a hosted service, you own your data. An open API will empower you to do whatever you like with your numbers — we’ve already built an OS X Dashboard widget, for example. Imagine what else you could do with your blog’s stats…</p>, <p>We’ll be opening the doors soon — probably towards the end of the year. For now, we’re metering our growth with an invitation system to ensure that we can provide an appropriate level of service for our users as we grow. You can sign up for one at measuremap.com.</p>, <p>In the coming weeks I’ll be writing more about Measure Map, the experience of building it, and what our plans for it are. But for now, I’m just so happy our little team has reached this milestone. Now back to work.</p>, <p>We’ve been testing and <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/index.php?s=measure+map"">writing about</a> (scroll through search results) measure map for some time, and are big fans.</p>, <p>A funny side note: At the web 2.0 conference last week I was talking with Kevin Burton and Andy Smith about some of the new applications we are excited about. Measure Map came up, and they asked for a demo because they hadn’t seen it. Some tall guy in the room joined us and listened while I demo’d the product for them. That tall guy turned out to be Jeffrey Veen – I hadn’t met him in person yet and so didn’t recognize him. At the end of the demo, when I still didn’t know who he was, he started clicking links and showing data I didn’t even know about. Some of it was incredibly cool stuff. I looked at his nametag and everything of course fell into place. Very funny.</p>]"

Memeorandum is the “newspaper” for anyone interested in what’s happening <u>right now</u> in <a href=""http://www.memeorandum.com"">politics</a> or <a href=""http://tech.memeorandum.com"">technology</a>.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Regarding my statement in the title of this post, I really do believe that Memeorandum is forcing a subtle but important shift in the way many of us use the web.</p>, <p>Memeorandum finds blog posts, newspaper articles and press releases that are being heavily linked to in near real time and puts them up on the site. The position and size of the headline is indicative of its importance (determined by number of links and other factors, such as how much people are writing about the linked content). The higher up and bigger the headline, the more important it is. And linking sites, <em>the conversation</em>, are clustered underneath the headline.</p>, <p>This means you can find out in near real time what is important in technology (or politics), how important it is, and who’s talking about it. If you then post on the subject, you will be linked into the discussion as well.</p>, <p>If I have limited time and I need to find out what’s going on, I turn to Memeorandum. I am on this site at least 15 times a day. I am finding that reading feeds in my reader (the old way I used to find out what was hot) takes much longer, has a much longer lag time, and significantly more noise (Memeorandum has virtually no noise – everything is relevant).</p>, <p>So Memeorandum is changing my reading behavior, but it is also changing my writing behavior. It is much easier for me to find and read everything that is being written about a topic (Memeorandum also includes links to the real time search engines for additional material). I find that I am more educated on the topics I write about, and am writing more often about things the web feels are important at the time.</p>, <p><a href=""http://tech.memeorandum.com"">It’s a damn ugly site</a>, but it is the most useful tool I have to discover real time content on the web.</p>]"

First Screen Shot of Sphere,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/spherebig.jpg""/></p>, <p>I met with <a href=""http://yodelt.wordpress.net/about"">Tony Conrad</a>, one of the founders of <a href=""http://www.sphere.com"">Sphere</a>, today at our office (ok, its a house, but it’s also an office – just ask the IRS). Sphere is a new blog search engine that quite frankly blows everything, and I mean everything, I’ve seen out of the water in terms of relevance (and, by the way, design…Adaptive Path was involved).</p>, <p>The timing for this meeting was perfect – right on the heels of Yahoo’s new <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/10/yahoo-blog-search/"">blog search engine</a>, and Robert Scobles already-classic post “<a href=""http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/10/13/the-race-to-time-based-and-blog-search/"">The race to time-based and blog search</a>“.</p>, <p>Tony, along with co-founders Steve Nieker and Martin Remy, and advisors Matt Mullenweg, Mary Hodder and Toni Schnieder, have created Sphere in a very short period of time and for “less than $200k”.</p>, <p>I saw the live site and was allowed to bang on it as much as I liked. I did, and came away very impressed.</p>, <p>Relevance in blog search is very difficult. Google-type PageRank analysis, which looks at incoming links to a piece of content, simply doesn’t work because new content doesn’t have much in the way of links. Until now, no one has come up with a way to properly sort blog posts by relevance, and the general default way of showing results is “reverse-chrono”, which simply puts the newest stuff at the top.</p>, <p>Sphere appears to have solved the problem, or at least taken big steps in the right direction. Their approach involves three key algorithms – an analysis of links into and out of a <u>blog</u>, an analysis of metadata around a post (links, post frequency, length of posts, etc.), and something Tony calls their “secret sauce”, which is content semantic analysis to filter out spam and to understand what a blog post is talking about.</p>, <p>Result sets show only two posts per blog on the first page, so no one blog can dominate a category. The result set has auto-generated profiles of blogs that include recent links in and out of the blog, average posts per week, average words per post and a link to a full page profile that can be edited by the blog author.</p>, <p>To the right of the main result set are blog (as opposed to post) links that are relevant to the query, and something they call the “Daily Sphere”, which is links to relevant non-blog news stories. I imagine they may add additional content in the side area as well.</p>, <p>The results page integrates both ajax and flash features in an intelligent way (it’s not there just for show).</p>, <p>While Sphere has been indexing blogs since January of 2003, their index only shows results for the previous four months. They will lengthen this window as they scale up operations.</p>, <p>Sphere has tens of thousands of beta requests and is opening up to 100 lucky people this weekend. <a href=""http://www.sphere.com"">Sign up for the beta here</a>.</p>]"
PreviewSeek – New Web Search Engine,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>PreviewSeek is a new London-based search engine created by Chris Hong that is very quietly impressing people with a number of innovating features.</p>, <p>Basic search results are great but nothing to get overly excited about. The useful features include disambiguation of queries (are you searching for “apple” the fruit, or “apple” the computer”?), preview of search pages (think Browster), and better refining of searches.</p>, <p>PreviewSeek does a good job at attempting to determine meaning from a query. Type in “<a href=""http://beta.previewseek.com/?where=web&amp;vid=l242319538I1129054663&amp;twin=n&amp;query=java&amp;x=0&amp;y=0"">Java</a>” and you get a result set with a numer of options for the query, including the island, the programming language, and even the coffee.</p>, <p>This is my favorite feature. PreviewSeek allows you to preview search results in much the same way as <a href=""http://www.browster.com"">Browster</a> (our <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/08/11/update-browster-firefox-surging-ahead/"">profile</a>), except without the download and the ads. It’s a great way quickly scan results without actually clicking away from previewseek.</p>, <p>For any given query PreviewSeek will suggest a number of refinement options on the left sidebar, which greatly assist in drilling down on a particular search.</p>]"
My Thoughts on Reading Lists,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">Dave Winer has been thinking about, and recently <a href=""http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2005/10/13#a1032"">writing</a> about, a new idea: Reading Lists.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.opml.org/"">OPML</a> is a really useful file structure that just about everyone who uses a feed aggregator, like bloglines, is already using without necessarily knowing it. Most readers keep subscribed feeds for a user in OPML format, for easy importing and exporting. If you <a href=""http://www.bloglines.com/help/faq#export"">export</a> your OPML feed you get a XML file of your feeds, which other feed readers understand.</p>, <p>The problem with opml files from readers is that they are static, meaning I can give you my OPML file but you will never know if I add or delete feeds unless I tell you and give you the new file. All you get is a snapshot of my feeds from the moment that I share my file with you.</p>, <p>Dave thinks these files should be dynamic, which means that I can share my opml file, or as he calls it my <em>reading list</em>, and anyone who subscribes to it will always have the current version, no matter how often I amend that list.</p>, <p>There is very little technology needed to allow this to happen – the various feed readers simply need to agree to support dynamic lists and allow people to share them permanently. Dave’s trying to make this happen.</p>, <p>If he succeeds, we’ll all be able to subscribe to reading lists from people we trust on a given subject, and good feeds will be that much easier to find.</p>, <p>Fred Oliveira <a href=""http://webreakstuff.com/blog/2005/10/reading-lists-a-new-way-for-opml/"">wrote</a> about this recently as well. In a comment, <a href=""http://gaijin.wordpress.com/"">Eric Lin</a> writes:</p>, <p>i could easily see this not only as a way to share my reading list with others i know, but also to be matched with others i donâ€™t know with common interests. what if the system could match me with other people who have similar tech, music or lifestyle feeds as i do. it would be a fantastic way to make new connections as well as strengthen existing ones, and i could see communities forming around overlapping feeds. these communities might be stronger than those that form around a single website because theyâ€™d have more in common.</p>, <p>Yeah, exactly. As soon as people start to think about this idea, a lot of other interesting ideas start to spring up.</p>, <p>A real world example of where we need this is our <a href=""http://www.web20workgroup.com"">Web2.0WorkGroup</a>. Feeds for each blog are linked, and we have a static OPML file that we are updating as new feeds join. However, because the file is static, anyone who downloads the file has to check back frequently as new feeds are added. Let’s automate this process.</p>]"

Web 2.0 This Week (October 9-15),"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">Tons of new companies launched this week. My guess is they were aiming for the Web 2.0 Conference last week but had to delay.

Normal language is translated into medical terms, and refinement options are shown for related information. For instance, a search for breast cancer shows refinement options for “treatment” and “symptoms”, as well as links to the broader search of “cancer”.</p>, <p>The HealthMaps feature is incredibly useful. It is a visual display of information relevant to your query. Do a search for “<a href=""http://www.healthline.com/search?q1=cancer"">cancer</a>” and click on the top left link just above the first result to see this. Clicking on any of the visual cues will give additional refined information. You can also see the HealthMap feature in the screen shot above.</p>, <p>Refinements, along with HealthMaps, is a very good way to find relevant information with a single search on a term even loosely related to the information you are looking for.</p>, <p>Healthline also offers browsing by channel, with topics ranging from Acne to Yeast Infections.</p>, <p>If you become a member, you can create news alerts, and tag and save search results.

I’m a big supporter of Flock. I am even writing this post while wearing a Flock tshirt. Flock is definitely the Flickr of browsers. :-)</p>, <p>The three most powerful tools Flock offers it’s users are bookmarks, blogging and a RSS reader.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>They’ve dropped their propreitary bookmarking engine and have replaced it with del.icio.us. I have a ton of del.icio.us bookmarks – thousands – and it took a while for the browser to chug through them all during the import procedure. But it did, and I now have one hell of an interface into my favorite bookmarking service. Since Flock supports tabbed browsing, I can keep bookmarks open in a separate tab and refer back whenever. Partnering with Del.icio.us is brilliant. I do not know if they have plans to integrate with other social bookmarking sites, but I imagine it would be fairly simple for them to do.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>The blogging tool was, and remains, absolutely the best I’ve seen. This tool brings flickr pictures directly into the blog tool, allowing simple drag and drop into the post.

Feeds can be tagged, and the viewer allows for expanded or collapsed feed viewing.</p>, <p>There are some speed issues with this version, 0.5, but in my opinion it has more than enough features to convince web users by the millions to switch from their default browser and go with Flock.

Today Randall Munroe’s webcomic <a href=""http://xkcd.com/"">XKCD </a>features an amusing clip mocking <a href=""http://www.premierelections.com/"">Premier Election Solutions</a>, formerly known as Diebold Election Systems, for installing anti-virus software on their voting machines.  For those unfamiliar with the subject matter, the comic suggests that there should be absolutely no need for security software on such devices, and if there is then Premier Election Solutions has made some extremely poor design choices.  Premier is using <a href=""http://www.mcafee.com/us/"">McAfee </a>anti-virus software, which indicates that their voting machines run a version of Windows.  However this in itself is completely overkill for the simplicity of the task, not to mention a security liability.</p>, <p>The voting machines were intended to increase accuracy, security, and overall efficiency during the voting process. This would have been feasible with a simple microcontroller, but Premier seems to have taken the wrong course of action, installing an Operating System that is not only susceptible to viruses but capable of running nontrivial anti-virus software.</p>, <p>Diebold also has a history of performance issues with its election technology.  They have since <a href=""http://news.thomasnet.com/companystory/528405"">changed their name</a> to shed this reputation, but the most recent incident confirms that the new entity is experiencing the same issues. Last week county boards in Ohio <a href=""http://www.daytondailynews.com/n/content/oh/story/news/local/2008/08/06/ddn080608votingweb.html"">filed suit</a> against the company for device malfunction and tabulation errors.  Apparently in all test cases their tabulation software failed to upload votes from memory cards while equipment indicated they had been counted. It’s alright though, Premier spokesman Chris Riggall has blamed the malfunctions on the McAfee anti-virus software.</p>, <p>As XKCD points out, someone is clearly doing their job horribly wrong.</p>]"

We have 8 slots.</p>, <p>We are also taking up to two additional corporate sponsors – this allows us to keep this event free. <a href=""mailto:editor@beta.techcrunch.com"">Email us</a> if you are interested. Package includes right to put up a banner, a toast/speech of up to 2 minutes and your logo on an event tshirt. Plus the happiness of knowing that people will love you and your company. :-)</p>, <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href=""http://wiki.beta.techcrunch.com/third_meetup"">This is 100% on. Wiki with information and signup area is here</a>. We need two additional sponsors to the two we have already. If you want your logo on the tshirts (free to everyone), we need to get confirmation of sponsorship by end of day today. Sorry for the complete lack of notice. The cost is $250 and will defray tshirt and catering costs.</p>, <p><strong>UPDATE #2:</strong> Sponsors include <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com"">Simply Hired</a>, <a href=""http://www.flock.com"">Flock</a> and <a href=""http://www.goowy.com"">Goowy</a>.

Top Five Web 2.0 Venture Capitalists,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">Most venture capitalists don’t understand tagging, blogs, rss, ajax, or the two way web. They scoff at social bookmarking sites and think podcasting is a fad (maybe it is). They desparately “want in” to this renaissance of the web, but can’t be bothered to open up the simplest RSS reader and understand the power of decentralized content. In short, they don’t get it.</p>, <p>Most traditional VC funds have a single web-focused partner, who may or may not be interested in web 2.0 consumer companies. For the most part, these VCs are not part of the most interesting deals. If they do get what you are pitching, they want to pump way more money into the company than makes sense.</p>, <p>Here’s my attempt to point out the venture capitalists <em>who do get it</em>. Some of these have new funds and only recently became venture capitalists. Some of them have been around forever. There are just two personality traits all share. First, they understand that a fundamental shift has occured in web evolution. Second, they are hungry as hell to find deals, and spend more time proactively looking for the next opportunity than they do sitting back and looking at the business plan stream that naturally flows into any venture fund.</p>, <p>This list is purely subjective. It’s blatantly biased. Some VCs don’t belong and many who do are left off. But it’s a list, nonetheless, that I’ve come up with over the last few weeks of interviewing entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and journalists.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.bvp.com/about/bio.asp?id=7"">David Cowan</a> is a partner at <a href=""http://www.bvp.com/"">Bessemer Venture Partners</a> and writes a blog called <a href=""http://whohastimeforthis.blogspot.com/"">Who Has Time For This</a>. He’s on this list partially because he incubated the hottest and most anticipated company on the web right now, Flock.</p>, <p>This guy picks winners. Of 43 early stage investments, 19 have gone public and 16 have been acquired. It could be because of his education – he has the killer combination of a math/CS degree and a MBA from Harvard.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.dfj.com/team/tim_bio.shtml"">Tim Draper</a> invested in Skype. Done.</p>, <p>He also sits on the board of SocialText, and his fund was in Baidu.</p>, <p>Tim will go anywhere in the world for the right deal. Most VC’s with 1/10th his net worth won’t leave silicon valley for a board meeting.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.augustcap.com/team/dh.shtml"">David Hornik</a> is is a General Partner at August Capital and writes a <a href=""http://www.ventureblog.com/"">blog</a> that has over 10,000 RSS readers.</p>, <p>David best asset is that he knows <em>everybody</em>. He’s the kind of guy you want to drink beers with while watching a football game.  If you are his friend, he’ll happily introduce you to anyone, and often puts two people together just because he thinks they should know each other.</p>, <p>He’s invested in companies that are defining the web today: SixApart and Technorati among them. And even if he doesn’t invest, he’ll do more than most VCs who have invested to help you. Here’s just one example – take a look at the things <a href=""http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2005/001216.html"">he says about Pandora</a>, which isn’t a portfolio company.</p>, <p>David has told me on numerous occasions that “the web is an ecosystem” and that he wants to play his part in making it healthy. He certainly does.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Josh Kopelman, through <a href=""http://www.firstroundcapital.com/"">FirstRoundCapital</a>, is quietly filtering through just about every young web 2.0 company, and investing in many of them.</p>, <p>Josh has a Wharton MBA and was the founder of Half.com, which was sold to ebay in 1998. His investments include Feedster, LinkedIn, Del.icio.us and, reportedly, Browster (and others).</p>, <p>Josh understand web 2.0 better than most entrepreneurs. His experience as an entrepreneur and growing huge businesses out of whole cloth is an incredible asset.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Fred Wilson is a founding partner of <a href=""http://www.unionsquareventures.com/"">Union Square Ventures</a> and writes the extremely popular <a href=""http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/"">A VC</a>. If you are new to web 2.0, start with his <a href=""http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/02/blogging_10.html"">Blogging 1.0</a> post. Then read the rest of his blog (even the stuff about music).</p>, <p>Fred was the original lead investor in del.icio.us, back when people were still scratching their heads about it. That enough gets him on the list. But Union Square’s <a href=""http://www.unionsquareventures.com/portfolio.html"">other investments</a>, including indeed, could also be major home runs.</p>, <p>It’s clear from his blog and what people say about him that he spends a lot of time working with his portfolio companies. He’s the kind of guy you want on your side when you go into battle.</p>, <p><strong>Jeff Clavier</strong> – <a href=""http://softtechvc.blogs.com/about.html"">Jeff</a> is a former VC and still makes the odd angel investment (Feedster, Truveo, and a few others). His <a href=""http://www.softtechvc.com/"">new venture</a> allows him to work with pre-funding companies and get them ready for prime time. In the last year, he’s worked with Userplane, Buzznet, UltraDNS, Glenbrook Networks, Loomia and two other undisclosed companies. If you have a hot idea and need advice, funding, introductions and anything else, Jeff may just take you on as a client and do what it takes to help you be successful – but like a VC, he’ll have to be convinced of your potential.<br/>

Read his <a href=""http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/term_sheet/index.html"">posts on Term Sheets</a> if you are in the process of raising capital. I keep trying to meet him but haven’t yet. Brad’s investments include invested in NewsGator, Feedburner and Technorati.</p>, <p><strong>O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures</strong> – This is the only non-person on here. <a href=""http://www.oatv.com"">OATV</a> just closed a $50 million fund to invest in young companies. Given the incredible access Tim O’Reilly has to these companies, OATV could quickly become an important fund in the web 2.0 space.</p>, <p><strong>Pierre Omidyar</strong> – <a href=""http://pierre.typepad.com/"">Pierre</a> founded ebay and is the Co-founder of <a href=""http://www.omidyar.net/index.html"">Omidyar Network</a>, where he’s invested in a number of interesting companies including EVDB, SocialText and Feedster, plus a few undiscloseds.

Peter also writes <a href=""http://earlystagevc.typepad.com/"">Early Stage VC</a>, another must-read blog. His investments include ojos, an incredible new photo-metadata service that is going to be extremely disruptive (and useful). Like others in this post, he’s a guy I’d want on my board. He’s gone through many battles as an entrepreneur in his time (he founded his first company in the early 80’s and worked at Infoseek in the late 90’s).<br/>

Voxeo Flies Under the Radar,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/ass.png""><img class=""shot"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/ass.png""/></a>IVR and VoIP provider <a href=""http://voxeo.com/"">Voxeo </a>has been putting up annual growth numbers near 100%, serving dozens of big name companies, and getting considerable attention from VC’s in the Valley as of late.  However, the company has remained largely under the radar since its founding in 2000, and has done so deliberately.  CEO Jonathan Taylor explained to us how keeping a low profile while doing high volume business has been easy in this particular industry.</p>, <p>In short, Voxeo does its job so well that its clients don’t talk about it.  When an enterprise discovers their platform they keep it a secret to preserve the competitive advantage.  As a result, Voxeo doesn’t even publish a list of notable customers. Relationships with clients have been so discreet that many of their customers are listed as competitors in market research briefs.</p>, <p>The company continues to grow at an impressive rate, and has recently expanded into foreign markets and started <a href=""http://www.voxeo.com/about/press_reader.jsp?date=081908_micromethod.jsp"">acquiring </a>smaller companies.  Taylor says they are being approached by several VC firms, but will most likely not announce anything until late September.  It will be interesting to see how much longer Voxeo maintains its underground profile.  Based on BT’s <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2008/07/29/bt-acquires-ribbit-for-105-million/"">valuation</a> of <a href=""http://www.ribbit.com/"">Ribbit</a>, they could be worth a whole lot of money.</p>]"

Socialight’s mobile and web tools give you access to location-based media on your mobile and on the web.</p>, <p>StickyShadows are virtual multimedia sticky notes that you create using your mobile phone or this web site. A StickyShadow is made up of media, such as text and a picture, and information about who can see it and when and where it’s available.</p>, <p>The idea of overlaying information on top of the real world by tagging and noting real places, while still connected to a social tissue (it’s your friends that get access to the information) is something that i’m particularly interested about. If it’s going to pick up or not is what we’ll see, but it’s nice to see helpful information pop into your familiar places.</p>]"

Memeorandum Hype and New Feature,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://tech.memeorandum.com"">Memeorandum</a> continues to be <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/12/memeorandum-is-changing-the-web/"">our news site of choice</a>, and it is starting to get real traction outside of the core blogosphere as well.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,69288,00.html"">Ryan Singel at Wired</a> posted an in depth review of Gabe Rivera’s Memeorandum this morning.</p>, <p>Gabe Rivera, the 32-year-old programmer who quit his job at Intel to found the site, says he built Memeorandum thinking of the “live web as an editor.”</p>, <p>“If you read blogs, you know that there is this conversation and that some articles are the talk of the day, and other posts have important things to say about those,” Rivera said. “If you built graphs in your mind of what the talk looks like, I think it looks like what I’ve done. I get the sense (Memeorandum) is just a natural representation of what is already going on.”</p>, <p>Rivera hopes the site will appeal to more than just the Ã¼berconnected, and could be useful as an entry point for those unfamiliar with blogs. To that end, the site’s design, which features large headlines and stories in declining order of importance, mimics that of an online newspaper.</p>, <p>“The best way for someone to get into (the) blogs thing is to find a blog that is tracking an issue important to you, because someone new to it can understand the headline and then go read the blog. I think my site works pretty well that way,” Rivera said. “My dad started using my site … a couple weeks later he spotted something he was interested in and now he knows all these bloggers.” </p>, <p>Congrats Gabe on the Wired article and the mainstread traffic it will send to Memeorandum. As I’ve said, Memeorandum is exceptional, and it is changing the web.</p>, <p><a href=""http://blog.memeorandum.com/051021/widgets"">Memeorandum also just released</a> a new feature – a great widget that bloggers and webmasters can include on their site showing the most recent tech.memeorandum headlines.

I hope its a good twist because this space is getting a bit crowded to say the least.</p>, <p>Ma.gnolia describes itself as “Found is the New Search” and “Social Bookmarking to build an information community online”, adding:</p>, <p>What you mark in Ma.gnolia not only stays found but keeps coming back to you as your interests change. That’s our pitch, plain and simple, and it’s why we say that found is the new search.</p>, <p>If youâ€™d like to be one of the first to see exactly what we mean, just enter your email below. Youâ€™ll be notified of our launch and become one of the first members of the Ma.gnolia community, where we believe youâ€™ll discover the new evolution in growing and sharing information across town or across the globe. You may even be invited to participate in Ma.gnoliaâ€™s December 2005 Beta Launch.</p>, <p>They promise a beta in December 2005. I’m skeptical of companies that continue to launch with these domain name abominations (dropping vowels, using random ccTLDs and lots of extra dots), but if the service rocks, I will forgive all. <a href=""http://www.zeldman.com/daily/1005g.shtml"">Early buzz</a> sounds promising.</p>]"
The PostSecret Book,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Frank Warren the creator of the increasingly <a href=""http://postsecret.blogspot.com/"">popular postsecret website</a> is now coming out with a book entitled <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060899190/techcrunch-20/002-1922935-6175214"">PostSecret : Extraordinary Confessions from Ordinary Lives</a>.</p>, <p>The PostSecret book is a hardcover with 288 pages published by Harper Collins/Regan Books. Inside, there are hundreds of color images of postcards. Many of the PostSecrets have never been seen before.</p>, <p>Postsecret has been a favorite site of mine. I wrote <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/06/18/profile-postsecret/"">about it back in July</a> (getting their permission to post more than a single image).  Thousands of people have sent postcards that tell a secret fear, regret, hope, fantasty, betrayal, confession, hope or experience.

Annotating Your Web with Stickis,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>In 1999 Eng-Sion Tan launched a company called Third Voice, a browser plug-in that created a sidebar on web pages and allowed surfers to annotate the page by adding their comments. The service quickly devolved into web graffiti and <a href=""http://wired-vig.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,42803,00.html"">shut it’s doors</a> two years later.</p>, <p>Even though Third Voice is gone, the idea had some value. And soon <a href=""http://www.activeweave.com/bios/"">Jean Sini and Marc Meyer</a> will be <a href=""http://www.activeweave.com/"">launching something</a> that has some of the characteristics of Third Voice, but which will not have the same graffiti result. They call it <a href=""http://www.activeweave.com/"">Stickis</a>.</p>, <p>Stickis is still in private alpha. I don’t have credentials yet (they are keeping it very quiet and don’t want screen shots on the web), but Marc and Jean came by last week to give me a peak at the service. You can <a href=""http://www.activeweave.com/"">request an alpha invitation on their home page</a>.</p>, <p>To be honest, it took me a while to get it. The reason: they’ve built a platform that has at least two or three killer applications and I saw so much in so short a time that I was getting lost. I slowed things down by asking dumb questions and, in the process became pretty fired up about stickis in general.</p>, <p>Once you are registered, you can add a “sticki” to any web page with your notes, which can be in the form of text or dragged in images. Every time you return to that page you can pull up your sticki. For lots of sites that I interact with, the ability to keep these notes is very interesting. Notes can be shared with friends or kept private.</p>, <p>You can also subscribe to feeds from other sites, and if those feeds have linked to the current site you are visiting that content will also appear in the stickis. For instance, If you were to go to the Sticki site, and you had subscribed to the TechCrunch feed, you would see this post included in the sticki.</p>, <p>They’ve also included a master page to manage the content you’ve distributed on various pages, and add feeds and friend’s content.</p>, <p>Marc and Jean are in the process of raising an angel round – everything to date has been created on their own dime and with their own time. They’ve been working on it for about a year.</p>]"
A Second Look at Inform.com,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/16/informcom-doesnt/"">We hammered</a> on <a href=""http://www.inform.com"">Inform.com</a> last week following their launch and a fluffy article in the New York Times.</p>, <p>Inform.com’s goal is to provide a useful news interface – both blog and non-blog – and to show the interconnectedness of all of the content.</p>, <p>We had a number of concerns with the service. It’s a full page popup to ensure that they entirely control the user experience. It doesn’t work properly in Firefox. You are limited to reading the content they provide (you can’t add content they haven’t included in the service). The scroll button on the mouse doesn’t work. Etc.</p>, <p>I received an email from Julian Steinberg, the project manager at Inform, a few days after my initial post. He offered a point-by-point response to each of my criticisms. We followed up with a phone call today. I am re-printing his email below (with his permission), and I want to point out a few positive aspects of the service as well that I discovered after he walked me through it.</p>, <p>Mike,</p>, <p>I read your review of Inform’s beta launch, and would like to take you up on your offer to clarify a few things about our product.  Hopefully this will help you see some value in the product, even in its beta form.</p>, <p>Most importantly â€“ and as you pointed out – we recognize the need to improve site usability and other shortcomings in performance. However, given the powerful new tools inherent in the product today, combined with our personal frustration consuming and using news, we felt the trade offs of putting out an early release were worth it.</p>, <p>Below are responses to your specific points, followed by some of what differentiates Inform.</p>, <p><strong>Re:  â€œI honestly can’t figure out what it is, even after reading the Times fluff piece. They say its an RSS Reader but adding feeds is anything but easy. Newbies need simplicity. Oldbies want something that handles a ton of feeds efficiently. This does neither.â€</strong></p>, <p>*  Inform isnâ€™t an RSS reader.  While the ability to add RSS feeds to Inform will be incorporated into an upcoming release, we are not an RSS reader today. However, you can ‘subscribe’ to any of the sources we cover today, including blogs, in a similar way to RSS feeds, and read them by section. Unlike many RSS readers, we crawl every article on every source we cover and include all the articles from each publication, whereas RSS readers may only include a portion of a publisherâ€™s content.</p>, <p><strong>Re:  â€œWhat it does do well is break. Early and often. They warned me that it was optimized for IE, but I’m a firefox guy and I charged ahead. Bad idea.â€</strong></p>, <p>* The only difference when using Inform with Firefox versus IE 6.0, is that we do not display articles directly within our reader.  Instead they pop-up in a new window or tab, which some users prefer while others clearly do not. Otherwise, the functionality is identical in the two browsers. We are committed to continuing to support Firefox users and working to enhance their experience.</p>, <p><strong>Re:  â€œThe UI is unworkable – even my scroll wheel on my mouse is disabled on the site.â€</strong></p>, <p>* Inform often displays two scrollable windows on many pages.  To activate a window for scrolling, you must click inside it first (similar to Outlook Web Access or a product that has multiple panes).</p>, <p><strong>Re:  â€œI try to find the good in new products, but I’m failing on this one. Please, tell me what I’m missing.â€</strong></p>, <p>Michael, this might be a better conversation than email exchange. We are genuinely interested in your feedback and Iâ€™d welcome the opportunity to discuss this by phone with you. I can be reached at 646 722 XXXX. We have a lot of enhancements planned for the future, and hope you will bear with us while we continue to improve Inform.</p>, <p>Julian Steinberg</p>, <p>This was a reasonable and articulate response to a fairly aggressive post. And other than the scroll wheel funtionality (it doesn’t work), his counterpoints are good ones.</p>, <p>Here’s what I learned from the walk through:</p>, <p>This is a beta, so thin content is excusable. They do an excellent job of relating content to other content via topics (basically keywords). They do a great job with filtered tagging (searching across multiplie keywords like “miami” and “football”), something no real time search engine does today and which is a really useful way of drilling down into new content. You can also toggle on/off blog and non-blog news.</p>, <p>New feature releases over the next couple of months include a video seach and viewing tool, better firefox integration and the ability to add feeds that are not currently already included at Inform. I’m looking forward to all of this.</p>]"

Kaboodle Launch: Bookmarking + Wiki,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.kaboodle.com"">Kaboodle</a> opened its doors this afternoon for an official launch on Wednesday.</p>, <p>I met with Manish Chandra, the CEO, earlier today for a walk through and came away very impressed. In addition to Manish, Kaboodle’s founders include Keiron McCammon and Chetan Pungaliya.</p>, <p>Kaboodle is a free social bookmarking service. And it really does take things to the next level in terms of usefulness, particularly for certain types of stuff. For instance, Kaboodle really shines when bookmarking ecommerce content.</p>, <p>The <a href=""http://www.kaboodle.com/zd/help/learnhow.html"">first thing to do</a> after registration is add a kaboodle button to your browser. When you click to bookmark content, you are redirected to Kaboodle where you select a “page” (topic). Content is auto-selected, including an image. A click lets you change or add to the content and/or select a new image.</p>, <p>Once you’ve added content to a page you can choose to make it public or private, and share it with others. New content can be added to a page from other sites. Each piece of content can be rated by others, and free-text comments can be added. It is an excellent way to collaborate with others in comparing and contrasting related content. In fact, in many ways Kaboodle reminds me of a wiki once the collaboration on a page begins.</p>, <p>Coming soon functionality includes page badges, search and RSS for users and pages. I’d also like to see tagging functionality added to pages and individual pieces of content.</p>, <p>Om Malik wrote a <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2005/10/25/the-whole-kit-kaboodle/"">lengthy post on Kaboodle</a> a few hours ago. In my opinion Manish Chandra and the rest of the team have done a great job rolling this out. They are talking to bloggers and mainstream press simultaneously, and the site is a textbook example of how to walk new users through how the service works. They’ve thought through launch strategy and usability in a very intelligent way.</p>]"

From there, all you have to do is click a button to record a voicemail. The sound file is saved as an MP3 and is attached to the email, which can also include text and other attachments. WaxMail is free, although there is a small text advertisement added to the email.

First Screen Shots of Riya,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.riya.com"">Riya</a> (formerly <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/20/ojos-is-now-riya/"">Ojos</a>) will be opening its doors to 10 or so lucky alpha testers tomorrow morning.</p>, <p>Riya leverages potent facial and text recognition technology with an intelligent interface to help people make sense of the thousands of untitled and untagged photos that are building up on their hard drives (and on the web).</p>, <p>We previously profiled Riya (then Ojos) on <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/08/31/ojos-auto-name-tag-your-photos/"">August 31, 2005</a></p>, <p>I went by Riya’s offices today and met with the <a href=""http://www.riya.com/corp/team.jsp"">team</a> to get a look at their product. According to <a href=""http://www.riya.com/corp/management.jsp"">Munjal Shah</a>, Riya’s CEO, I am the first outsider to get a chance to bang on the live product. Given how hot Riya is right now, I consider that a huge honor.</p>, <p>The process starts with registration and choosing a privacy setting on your pictures. You then download a client application that uploads photos you choose to include in Riya. The actual uploading takes a while – about 4 hours for each GB of photos. Instead of waiting around, Riya will email you when the process is complete.</p>, <p>That’s when the fun starts. In my case about 400 pictures were uploaded. I was presented with a view of facial thumbnails of everyone in my photos. Riya asks that you begin to educate it by telling it who the people are…it then very quickly starts to auto-tag pictures with a surprising level of accuracy.</p>, <p>Riya also recognizes text in photos, and lets you select any area of a photo and tag that as well. For instance, you could select just the Eiffel Tower in a photo and tag it as such. Within moments, everything of importance in all of my photos was tagged. And more importantly, <em>it was searchable</em>.</p>, <p>It’s an easy step to allow friends to also tag and search your photos (if you choose), and even allow full public search.</p>, <p>Linking these two features – massively automated tagging of everything in photos, with search, is compelling to say the least. The folks at Riya call it “tag locally, search globally”.</p>, <p>Riya is going to be successful. They have real technology. And, as people use it to tag photos, Riya will create a database of unique attributes of people. Once enough people start using the service, Riya will be able to auto-tag people’s names with less and less training by the user. At that point, why would anyone try a competing service? Riya will have technology (protected by patents) and an incredible network effect as well.</p>, <p>Riya plans on having a destination site that will be free, and will OEM their service to other photo services. Sites like flickr can certainly try to duplicate Riya’s service, but unless they move very quickly Riya’s network effect Riya will be insurmountable.</p>, <p>In fact, Riya could become so ubiquitous as to actually cause real privacy concerns. One question I asked the team today was – “what if you get so much data on people that I could take a picture of a crowd, upload it to Riya, and instantly have the names of every single person in the crowd?” Apparently, their technology is not that powerful – yet. Riya’s ability to know who’s in a photo is largely based on who you are and the people you are connected to.</p>, <p>To fully appreciate Riya you have to see it visually. I’ve posted a few screen shots below of my experience using it earlier today.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/riya1.jpg""/><br/>

Zopa syndicates small loans out to many people, taking a fee..</p>, <p>Whois information on the domain (registered at register.com) shows the company is located in San Francisco.</p>, <p>Something about the rumor must be wrong…Benchmark has also<a href=""http://www.benchmark.com/portfolio/financial.shtml""> invested</a> in Zopa, which has announced that they will be launching in the U.S. at some point.</p>, <p><strong>Update:</strong> An ebay employee has joined circleone and has a profile on LinkedIn (I am not going to point to it). This person describes CircleOne in the profile as follows:</p>, <p>CircleOne is a consumer loan platform through which people can borrow money by setting their own interest rates, like an eBay for personal loans.</p>, <p>CircleOneâ€™s founding principle is that people from close communities act more responsibly towards each other. CircleOne leverages this powerful concept of group responsibility and applies it to person-to-person lending â€“ resulting in better interest rates for people that borrow and lend.</p>]"
My New Blog,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>I’ve launched a new companion blog to TechCrunch called <a href=""http://www.crunchnotes.com"">CrunchNotes</a>. I wrote a longish <a href=""http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=2"">introductory post</a> describing exactly why it exists (and why TechCrunch exists), but here’s the essence:</p>, <p><strong>So, why am I starting CrunchNotes?</strong> The main reason is that I find that sometimes, I want to talk about more than just new companies and products. Sometimes I have something to say about whatâ€™s going on in the blogosphere or the world. Sometimes I want to link to something interesting another blogger has written, but which has nothing to do with new companies. I found that doing that on TechCrunch tends to dilute the core value of that blog.</p>, <p>Yeah, I just quoted myself. Sorry. It won’t happen again.</p>, <p>If you are interested in reading CrunchNotes, here’s the feed: <a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/crunchnotes"">http://feeds.feedburner.com/crunchnotes</a>.</p>, <p>Thanks to <a href=""http://www.webreakstuff.com"">Fred Oliveira</a>, who designed CrunchNotes (and TechCrunch).</p>]"
Shadows 1.0,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>I had an early peak at <a href=""http://www.shadows.com"">Shadows</a> while it was still in beta, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/07/18/profile-shadows/"">back in July</a>. Shadows is a <a href=""http://www.pluck.com"">Pluck</a> product.</p>, <p>Last week, Pluck took the beta tag off of Shadows and <a href=""http://www.pluck.com/press/PluckPR-051017-ShadowsLaunch.html"">released v 1.0</a>. Dave Panos, Pluck’s CEO, gave me a walk through of the new functionality last night.</p>, <p>Shadows is a social bookmarking site with good features, and all of the expected bells and whistles. But the reason I like it so much is that they’ve come up with a really interesting application for all the bookmark data they collect – shadow pages.</p>, <p>If you choose to install their toolbar, you can click on “Shadow Page” from any web page and be redirected to that page’s Shadow Page. This page is a collection of metadata gathered from user bookmarks.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>For instance, here is the <a href=""http://www.shadows.com/shadows.aspx?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.apple.com%2fipodnano%2f"">Shadow Page</a> for Apple’s <a href=""http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/"">iPod Nano</a>. The Shadow Page includes notes from users who have bookmarked the iPod Nano web page, a tag cloud of tags used to describe the page, users who’ve tagged it, etc. A user can choose to make any bookmark private, but any public bookmarks are included on the Shadow Page.</p>, <p>It’s a really unique product and a good twist on social bookmarking.</p>, <p>Shadows also has set up groups, like <a href=""http://www.shadows.com/group/web2"">this one</a> for Web 2.0. Links are automatically collected here by users who tag pages with “web2.0”. There is also a tab for a general discussion that any user can participate in.</p>, <p>The fact that all of this metadata for websites is being collected is not that interesting. What <em>is interesting</em> is that anyone can access this site metadata (and only that site’s metadata) by simply clicking a button in a toolbar.</p>, <p>Shadows has been slowly building up a loyal user base, many of which are interested in highly niche content. An example is this Shadow Page on <a href=""http://www.shadows.com/group/harrypotter"">Harry Potter</a>. An entire community has emerged around this page, with users writing their own Harry Potter fiction, thousands of discussion items, etc. As more groups are formed (and users will soon have the ability to create a group on the fly, based on how they tag a page), more of these microcommunities will sprout, generating lots of page views for Shadows.</p>]"
Wow! Del.icio.us rolls out more stuff,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>In addition to the robust and open <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/24/337/"">search functionality released</a> by Del.icio.us earlier this week, there are at least two additional new features that are worth noting. I also have a few more thought on the search function below.</p>, <p>Del.icio.us has <a href=""http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/10/we_rock.html"">built a media player directly into the site</a>. If you find a link to a MP3 file, a small icon appears to the left of the bookmark that can be clicked to play the file. <a href=""http://del.icio.us/popular/system:filetype:mp3"">Try it out</a>.</p>, <p><a href=""http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/10/bundle_up.html"">Tag Bundles</a> are, effectively, tags of tags. This feature existed before, but it is now much easier to create and edit tag bundles with a simple click of tags.</p>, <p>I’ve been using the del.icio.us search function a lot over the last few days. For certain searches, del.icio.us has far more relevant results than any other real time engine. The data isn’t necessarily deep, but the top result is super relevant. More on this (possibly) later, but del.icio.us may have just very quietly created the best (real time) search engine on the web.</p>, <p>One last thing. Someone pointed out to me recently that <a href=""http://www.delicious.com"">delicious.com</a> is now redirecting to del.icio.us. The domain is registered under Joshua’s name. I think it’s a great move to obtain the domain, and I wouldn’t mind a re-brand with the new URL.</p>]"
Blogniscient v.

An old screenshot of the service is <a href=""http://www.technosight.com/images/blogniscient.jpg"">here</a>.</p>, <p>Blogniscient is a blog news organizer that, like <a href=""http://tech.memeorandum.com"">Memeorandum</a>, uses a propreitary algorithm for determining what’s hot in the blogosphere at any given time. Unlike <a href=""http://www.digg.com"">Digg</a>, which creates news items based on user bookmarking and subsequent voting to determine front page items, Blogniscient and Memeorandum are automated.</p>, <p>Another similarity: both have hard to remember, and difficult to spell, domain names. :-)</p>, <p>Memeorandum has two verticals currently: <a href=""http://www.memeorandum.com"">Politics</a> and <a href=""http://tech.memeorandum.com"">Tech</a>. Blogniscient has five: politics, tech, sports, entertainment and business. Blogniscient also has an “all category”, and additional tabs for “top blogs” and “freshest stuff”.</p>, <p>Memeorandum does not rank blogs publicly. They include new content on the top right area of the site, and additional new content on the bottom left. Memeorandum also includes older content that has fallen from the main area, on the bottom right of the site.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Blogniscient just posts a link and summary of top articles. Memorandum goes two steps further – showing blogs that contribute to the discussion, as well as a permalink for the entire discussion group. For instance, Blogniscient’s new launch is the top story on Memeorandum right now, which you can see by <a href=""http://tech.memeorandum.com/051029/p12#a051029p12"">clicking here</a>, even after it’s fallen off as stale news.</p>, <p>Memeorandum appears more transparent in their ranking because you can actually see and link to blogs which have contributed to the discussion.</p>, <p>Memeorandum also can show news items from major publications like the New York Times, and press releases, as the main news items. Linking blogs are shown in the discussion area. I also find this to be a very useful feature.</p>, <p>Taking everything into consideration, I still believe that Memeorandum is a better service. I’ll use Blogniscient too, but Memeorandum has <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/12/memeorandum-is-changing-the-web/"">actually changed the way I approach the web</a> – I spend more time on Memeorandum than any other website.</p>]"

Speak With Me – Control Your Car by Voice,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>I had the opportunity to sit down with Ajay Juneja, the founder of Mountain View based <a href=""http://www.speakwithme.com"">Speak With Me</a>, at Tag Camp this weekend. I had a half hour demo in his car and was completely blown away by what he’s created. You can see pictures of Ajay and his car <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelarrington/tags/speakwithme/"">at my flickr account</a>.</p>, <p>What’s so special about his car? He’s layered a proprietary dialog manager, which semantically parses and analyzes data, on top of off-the-shelf speech recognition software, to create one kick ass computer system that is controlled with an array microphone. It allows you to control your car via speech. It was jaw-droppingly impressive.</p>, <p>For the demo, Ajay controlled his stereo system verbally, changing songs, picking tracks, controlling volume, etc. The commands he used to do this were in absolutely plain English and varied considerably in structure. For instance, Ajay at one time said “go to track 3”. Another time he said “play for me another one bites the dust”. Later, “I would like to hear wonderful tonight by eric clapton. “louder”. “quieter”.</p>, <p>Everything worked. No errors. Perfect. He repeatedly tried to trick the system by asking for a song with the wrong artist, etc. The system simply asked him, in its charmingly computerish voice, whether he wanted to hear the song, or a song by the artist.</p>, <p>Ajay then showed me their navigation product, which will integrate into car’s existing nav systems. Drivers will be able to control many aspects of the driving experience verbally once this product is commercially available.</p>, <p>I didn’t want to get out of the car. Frankly, I wanted to find a way to steal his car.</p>, <p><a href=""http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/08/18.html#a10902"">Robert Scoble saw Ajay’s car </a>months ago at BarCamp. He agreed (verbally) to a non disclosure agreement and couldn’t talk much about it. Now, Ajay’s company has advanced enough that he is talking about many aspects of the product, and giving demo’s, without NDAs in place.</p>, <p>Ajay graduated from the computer science program, with a minor in robotics, at Carnegie Mellon University. He also took graduate courses at the language technologies institute (see also the speech to speech product <a href=""http://tech.memeorandum.com/051030/p15#a051030p15"">being discussed</a> all over the web today, which is has also been developed at Carnegie Mellon), where this software has been under development for ten years. The original Carnegie Mellon researcher on the technology behind speakwithme is Matthias Denecke, who is now an advisor to Ajay.</p>, <p>Speak With Me will not be commercially available until at least late 2007, when it will be built directly into cars (they are negotiating deals now) and available at high end car stereo shops. The car stereo product will be around $400-$600, and the navigation system will be in the $2,500 range.</p>, <p>They will also offer additional services. One example – the car’s voice can be a celebrity. Ajay asked me how I’d like to have Paris Hilton, or whoever, interact with me to control my stereo and navigation system. Yep, I’d be up for that.</p>]"
Real Estate vertical search with Trulia,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/trulialogo.jpg"" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.trulia.com"">Trulia</a> is a  vertical search engine for real estate. Pete Flint and Sami Inkinen, Stanford MBAs, founded Trulia in 2004, and just moved their ten person company into shiny new offices in San Francisco. Trulia is currently angel funded.</p>, <p>The site launched a month ago with California listings only. Trulia will be rolling out new states (the next one will be this week) in the near future.</p>, <p>Like Oodle, Trulia pulls its content from multiple, distributed sources. In Trulia’s case, its data is indexed from real estate professionals’ websites, where the most detailed information on home listings is located. Trulia often has listings that aren’t included in the MLS, either because the agent hasn’t uploaded the listing yet, or for some new home construction, they never appear in the MLS at all.</p>, <p><img class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/trulia.jpg"" style=""float:left;""/>The site, which is advertiser supported, has excellent integration with Google maps and provides email and RSS notifications of new search results. Another feature that I really like are the statistics. For any given search, Trulia will show statistics on average home prices per bedroom (but for some reason no average across all home listings), average time a home is on the market, average price per square foot, etc.</p>, <p>Trulia does not show for sale by owner listings at this time. Their main goal, in addition to providing a rich user experience, is to serve real estate professionals by lowering their marketing costs and driving traffic to their websites. Pete tells me that indexing information from professionals’ sites is not easy – it has to be properly parsed and formatted for re-display on Trulia, and duplicate listings removed (some websites show listings from third party agents).</p>]"
CourseCafe Adds to the Social Bookmarking Discussion,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.coursecafe.com"">CourseCafe</a> is a search and social bookmarking tool for students that the founder, Puneet Gupta, demo’d at TagCamp last weekend. The company is located in Mountain View and is angel funded.</p>, <p>At first blush, the question came to mind as to why students can’t just use existing search tools like Google and social bookmarking applications like del.icio.us to handle their research needs. After the demo I understood why CourseCafe may be compelling for students to use on top of existing services.</p>, <p>The site, which is currently under closed beta, has automatically uploaded entire course schedules for most colleges and universities in the U.S. Students can quickly add the courses they are taking. As the company gets some history behind it, the bookmarks saved from previous semesters in the same course will stay available to students, giving them a good start on finding relevant web documents.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>Search is integrated directly into the site using Yahoo and Google APIs. A bookmarklet is also available for sites found outside of CourseCafe. Bookmarking and tagging a link is straightforward and functional. All students of a course that bookmark items will be able to see other’s bookmarks, creating additional value for students (and reasons to use the site). There are other great features as well, such as limiting searches to .edu sites.</p>, <p>CourseCafe is young and raw right now. But if they can find a way to tap into the <a href=""http://blog.softtechvc.com/2005/10/the_facebook_un.html"">college crowd like Facebook has</a> (<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/85-of-college-students-use-facebook/"">our profile of Facebook</a>), there’s a good chance they’ll have some success.</p>, <p>There are obvious product extensions as well, such as hosting notes and other course information.</p>]"
The Open Source RSS Reader,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>I’ve been using <a href=""http://www.blogbridge.com"">Blogbridge</a> for a few weeks now. It’s the first time I’ve seriousy used a desktop application to read feeds – I really like web based readers because there is no software download, compatibility issues, etc., and because many of the desktop readers are not free. But so many Blogbridge fans have emailed me suggesting I try it out that I did. And based on what I’ve seen, I give it a thumbs up.</p>, <p>Blogbridge is also open source. The founder, Pito Salas, tells me that there are at least six non-employee developers contributing to the project. There is a business model – Blogbridge eventually hopes to roll out premium features on top of the open source code base. For now, everything is free.</p>, <p>Blogbridge comes in three flavors – Windows XP, Mac OS X and Linux. It is written entirely in Java. There are new releases weekly – the current release is v. 2.7.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>The default user interface is three panes. Folders on the left, feeds in the middle and posts on the right. Importing OPML files is a snap, you can read feeds offline (a big benefit over web based readers), and they are actively supporting Dave Winer’s <a href=""http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2005/10/13#a1032"">Reading List</a> idea (although no integration yet).</p>, <p>Each pane has scroll bars, meaning, like Bloglines, you can scroll through the pane without losing your place in other panes (something that drives me crazy with other readers). Like all readers it seems, Blogbridge does a poor job properly rendering HTML, so posts look a little off.</p>, <p>Blogbridge also has <a href=""http://www.blogbridge.com/experts.php"">expert guides</a> to assist users in finding feeds relevant to their interests. Lots of people I know and respect are on that list, including <a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/"">Richard MacManus</a>, <a href=""http://softtechvc.blogs.com/about.html"">Jeff Clavier</a>, <a href=""http://bayosphere.com/blog/dangillmor"">Dan Gillmor</a>, and <a href=""http://blog.holtz.com/"">Shel Holtz</a>.</p>, <p>I’m a big fan of open source projects, and Blogbridge is an excellent reader.

Tag Camp Photo Album with Picaboo,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>I first heard about <a href=""http://www.picaboo.com"">Picaboo</a> from <a href=""http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/10/25/trulia-real-estate-listing-winning-raves-in-silicon-valley/"">Robert Scoble</a> a few days ago. Picaboo is a way to create, share and print photo albums.</p>, <p>Picaboo was founded in September 2002 by Howard Field and Kevin McCurdy, and is funded by Kleiner Perkins and Softbank. They launched in May 2005.</p>, <p>It only works on Windows right now (although Mac user have built in software for this stuff that works very well already). Picaboo requires a client download and the album editing occurs on this client. While I’d prefer a web app (flash or ajax), having a desktop client does speed things up considerably.</p>, <p>Picaboo is free to download, and creating and sharing albums is also free. They generate revenue from the sale of printed albums and dvds. A printed photo album is $25 plus shipping and includes up to 20 pages. Each additional page is $2.</p>, <p>I spent a considerable amount of time this evening test the software, creating an album and sharing it with <a href=""http://www.solutionwatch.com"">Brian Benzinger</a> to test out the features.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>The user interface is extremely easy to use and required little or no help or FAQ reference.You simply upload pictures, choose a format for the album, add text, etc.</p>, <p>There are a wide variety of album choices. You can also add music, or any other sound file (commentary, for instance). One thing I didn’t like is that the pictures must be locally stored before uploading. You cannot, for instance, give it a flickr username and use those pictures.</p>, <p>Once you’ve created an album, you can share it with “pals”, who can, if they’ve downloaded the picaboo software, view the album and add to it, creating their own version. You can also publish an album to the web for viewing by anyone. For some reason, the web version of albums will not play any music or other sound file you’ve assocated with it (a serious flaw in my opinion).</p>, <p><a href=""http://preview.picaboo.com/Preview/album.aspx?user=0000000000001E9DA6&amp;album=0000000000001E9DD6""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>I used photos from last weekend’s tagcamp event to create an album, <a href=""http://preview.picaboo.com/Preview/album.aspx?user=0000000000001E9DA6&amp;album=0000000000001E9DD6"">which can be viewed here</a>.

Windows Live – More than an AJAX Desktop,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>I blogged my raw, unedited notes from the Microsoft press meeting today <a href=""http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=18"">real time on CrunchNotes</a>. One of the two major announcements was <a href=""http://www.live.com"">Windows Live</a> (best viewed on IE of course). Office Live was also announced, which I will be writing about later tonight.</p>, <p>Windows Live is a free, ad-supported AJAX virtual desktop. Most of the functionality could be seen in the Microsoft sandbox project called <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/08/03/profile-msn-startcom/"">Start</a>, which we profiled a couple of months ago.</p>, <p>However, Microsoft has added plenty of new features that add a lot of value to the product. Among them are email integration, a new instant messaging client, plaxo-like contact management and skype-like features that allow outgoing calls to normal POTS phones. Windows Live is also extensible via “gadgets”. After what I saw today, I despair for many a silicon valley startup.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>The core features include a (now) standard AJAX desktop, wich a drag and drop interface, options to change the number of columns, ability to save searches, etc. There is a pre-populated feed reader on the left column, and adding new feeds is a one-click affair.</p>, <p>The really special stuff, though, are the <strong>Gadgets</strong>. These are third party applications that can be added to Windows Live via the Add Content feature on the top left. For current gadgets, check out <a href=""http://microsoftgadgets.com"">MicrosoftGadgets.com</a>.</p>, <p>One Gadget I added was the Flickr viewer. Adding it takes a couple of steps, and you are able to view Flickr photo’s via tags. Since anyone can create a gadget, I’d expect to see thousand so options in the near future.</p>, <p>You can add a mail account directly to the Windows Live page and get Outlook Express-like functionality directly on the browser. This technology looks to come directly from the <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/10/hotmail-expanding-kahuna-beta/"">Kahuna</a> project, which we have written about several times.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>This was the coolest thing I saw demo’d today. Windows Live will soon have a new instant messenger client embedded on the site.  The IM feature will include the ability to make outbound POTS calls, like Skype. They’ve leapfrogged Google’s Gtalk in this regard.</p>, <p>There is also an advanced contact management feature that bakes in plaxo-like features (you control your own contact info and people pull it to keep updated).</p>, <p>Blake Irving walked us through a demo that included a search for restaurants near the TransAmerica Building in San Francisco. As he zoomed in and narrowed his choices, he chose a restaurant, and via a click called the resaurants’s normal phone line to make a reservation. I took a picture, which is <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelarrington/58675997/in/set-1267546/"">up on flickr</a>. The VOIP caller is pictured to the left.</p>, <p>The IM functionality will be released in December.</p>, <p>That’s all I’m going to profile for now. Additional features are discussed at <a href=""http://ideas.live.com/"">ideas.live.com</a>. <strong>I want to repeat, what really got me today was the Gadget extensibility and the full VOIP IM integration.</strong></p>]"
Office Live Will Be A Huge Productivity Tool,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>The other product announced yesterday at the Microsoft Preview event in San Francisco was <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/office/officelive/default.mspx"">Office Live</a>.

Rajesh Jha presented the product.</p>, <p>Office Live is <u>not</u> an online version of Office.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>Office Live is a set of free, ad-supported productivity tools for businesses that will really help the small guys. The service will also have a premium subscription product that will have “less” ads, according to Bill Gates yesterday.</p>, <p>The core tools are a free non-microsoft domain name, website and up to 50 email accounts with 2 GB of storage each. Rajesh created a new website in the demo, adding content and images, in a minute or so. For a small company needing a informational website, it will be great. Given that the domain name, website building, hosting and email will all be free, this will be very attractive to a small business.</p>, <p>For customers needing more, Microsoft will offer a suite of additional productivity applications – 22 in all were announced yesterday. They will also support third party applications – ADP’s payroll software was shown integrated into Office Live. A set of APIs will be available for third parties to add their application functionality into Office Live.</p>, <p>Among the additional applications was an office document collaboration tool. You can share an office document real time with others, allowing them to view and edit it.

New Yahoo Maps Shows Power of Flash,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>An all new <a href=""http://maps.yahoo.com/beta"">Yahoo Maps</a> <a href=""http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000209.html"">launches tonight</a> at 9 pm PST.</p>, <p>I spoke with Paul Levine, the General Manager of Local, Jeremy Kreitler, a Senior Product Manager of Maps and Local, and Diana Vincent, a PR Manager, earlier today about Yahoo Maps.</p>, <p>Unlike Google and Microsoft maps, Yahoo has chosen to use Flash over AJAX in building its new service, and they’ve added new features that are not found anywhere else. They’ve also done some things to reduce the hassle of creating, sharing and printing maps online.</p>, <p>It’s built with on the new MacroMedia Flex platform for flash, something we’ve been hearing a lot about lately.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Because Yahoo Maps is a flash application, it avoids the need for page refreshes changes are made to the page. A simple drag and drop module on the top right lets users move around easily (even easier than the great Google drag method). There are multiple ways to zoom into and out of a map, including using the scroll wheel on the mouse, or the page up/down buttons on the keyboard. The arrow keyboard keys also allow for scrolling off-screen to new areas.</p>, <p>There is excellent integration wth Yahoo Local businesses. Once a map is pulled up, a quick search, such as “pizza” pulls up all local restaurants. A click shows more information, and options to add it to the driving directions itinerary.</p>, <p>And this is cool – they allow multipoint directions, something Google and Microsoft don’t have.. add as many stops as you need, in the order you want, and Yahoo Maps will calculate driving directions for the whole trip. This could be really useful when house hunting, for instance. Simply add all of the addresses and get an itinerary.</p>, <p>And as you edit the map by moving, adding things, etc., the URL in the browser bar self updates so that it can be copied and pasted at any time. This is something that really bugs me about Google Maps – the need to click a link to get a permanent URL. Yahoo’s solved that with some cool javascript coding.</p>, <p>Because Yahoo Maps is built on Flash, the “back button” on the browser still works (a problem with AJAX applications). At any time you can back up into older maps and the URL also rewinds.</p>, <p>Yahoo Maps requires the installation of Flash 7 or greater. 90% of U.S. and European computers already have it installed.</p>, <p>Yahoo has two flavors of <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.net/maps"">APIs for developers</a>. The syndication API is a simple way of bringing Yahoo Maps into a website in either Flash of AJAX. They’ve also launched a richer Building Blocks API for maximum flexibility.</p>]"
Technorati Extends Search Functionality,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://niallkennedy.com/blog/"">Niall Kennedy</a> at <a href=""http://www.technorati.com"">Technorati</a> has just informed me that they have quietly updated their <a href=""http://technorati.com/tags/"">tag search engine</a> with full boolean search functionality.</p>, <p>In August, Technorati <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/08/17/update-technorati-multiple-tag-search/"">added the OR function</a> to tag search. On a search for “apple OR microsoft”, the results would include any posts that included either tag. While useful, this functionality essentially just reduced the number of searches a user needed to perform to find posts with relevant information.</p>, <p>They’ve now added AND and NOT functions, which significantly help narrow result sets for specific searches. For instance, a user looking for blog posts on both <a href=""microsoft AND web2.0"">Microsoft and Web2.0</a> (89 results) can now easily find those results, instead of sifting manually through a much larger result set for just Microsoft (16,627 results) or Web2.0 (5,717 results). Technorati has in an instant just given the user the 89 results that he or she really cares about.</p>, <p>The NOT function is just as useful. Want to refine the result set above even more? Try “<a href=""http://technorati.com/tag/microsoft%20NOT%20office%20NOT%20windows%20NOT%20msn%20AND%20web2.0"">microsoft NOT office NOT windows NOT msn AND web2.0</a>” to narrow it down to just 66 results.</p>, <p>Yes, these are advanced functions, but as the number of blog posts continues to skyrocket and publisher tagging is becoming more ubiquitous, users need tools to quickly refine result sets and find what they are looking for. By adding this functionality, Technorati made tagging more valuable.</p>]"

Google Lunch?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>As many people know, Google offers its employees free lunch and free dinner at the campus (Yahoo charges its employees).

However, the dining area has no specific security into or out of it. If you can get past parking security, you can walk right in and eat.</p>, <p>Like much on TechCrunch, this is pure rumor. But I’ve heard from multiple independent sources that non-Google employees are making a game out of getting onto the Google campus, without an escort, and eating a free lunch, often taking a second lunch “to-go” for dinner. These people are keeping score to see who can eat the most free, unescorted lunches at Google. And specifically, my understanding is that many or all of these people are Yahoo employees.

Amazon finally reveals itself as the Matrix,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Amazon’s new <a href=""http://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome"">Mechanical Turk</a> product is brilliant because it will help application developers overcome certain types of problems (resulting in the possibility for new kinds of applications) and somewhat scary because I can’t get the Matrix-we-are-all-plugged-into-a-machine vision out of my head.</p>, <p>The “machine” is a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=sc_fe_c_1_3435361_1/002-1922935-6175214?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;node=15879911&amp;no=3435361&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA"">web service</a> that Amazon is calling “artificial artificial intelligence.” If you need a process completed that only humans can do given current technology (judgment calls, text drafting or editing, etc.), you can simply make a request to the service to complete the process. The machine will then complete the task with volunteers, and return the results to your software.</p>, <p>Volunteers are paid different amounts for each task, and money earned is deposited into their Amazon accounts. Amazon keeps a 10% margin on what the requester pays.</p>, <p>Today, we build complex software applications based on the things computers do well, such as storing and retrieving large amounts of information or rapidly performing calculations. However, humans still significantly outperform the most powerful computers at completing such simple tasks as identifying objects in photographs â€“ something children can do even before they learn to speak.</p>, <p>When we think of interfaces between human beings and computers, we usually assume that the human being is the one requesting that a task be completed, and the computer is completing the task and providing the results. What if this process were reversed and a computer program could ask a human being to perform a task and return the results? What if it could coordinate many human beings to perform a task?</p>, <p>Amazon Mechanical Turk provides a web services API for computers to integrate Artificial Artificial Intelligence directly into their processing by making requests of humans. Developers use the Amazon Mechanical Turk web services API to submit tasks to the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, approve completed tasks, and incorporate the answers into their software applications. To the application, the transaction looks very much like any remote procedure call – the application sends the request, and the service returns the results. In reality, a network of humans fuels this Artificial Artificial Intelligence by coming to the web site, searching for and completing tasks, and receiving payment for their work.</p>, <p>All software developers need to do is write normal code. The pseudo code below illustrates how simple this can be.</p>, <p>read (photo);<br/>
photoContainsHuman = callMechanicalTurk(photo);<br/>
if (photoContainsHuman == TRUE){<br/>
    acceptPhoto;<br/>
}<br/>
else {<br/>

}</p>, <p>The name “Mechanical Turk” is a great one because it refers to a machine built in the 18th century that played chess against real people and beat them regularly.

Comparing The Flickrs of Video,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>I’ve been tracking a number of sites that offer flickr-like services for video.</p>, <p>I’ve taken a look at as many of these services that I could find. The most well known is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/"">YouTube</a>, which we <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/08/08/profile-youtube/"">profiled in August</a> and which recently raised venture money from Sequoia.</p>, <p>But there are at least eight others worth looking at as well. In addition to YouTube, these are <a href=""http://www.castpost.com"">CastPost</a>, <a href=""http://www.clipshack.com"">ClipShack</a>, <a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com"">DailyMotion</a>, <a href=""http://www.grouper.com"">Grouper</a>, <a href=""http://www.ourmedia.org"">OurMedia</a>, <a href=""http://www.revver.com"">Revver</a>, <a href=""http://www.vimeo.com"">Vimeo </a>and <a href=""http://www.vsocial.com"">vSocial</a>.</p>, <p>Instead of writing individual profiles on each of these, I’ve created a quick chart that give a basic overview of the features. I’ve included only those companies that provide a web-based (v. client) service that hosts the videos on your behalf. Because of these requirements, great services like <a href=""http://www.videoegg.com"">VideoEgg</a> (<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/09/21/videoegg-launches/"">profile</a>) are not included.</p>, <p>Here’s the chart. I’ll update it as needed.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/11/videoflickr.jpg""/></p>, <p>Most of these companies convert video to Flash. This reduces file size significantly and also allows most platforms and browsers to easily view the content. Two, Vimeo and DailyMotion, convert files to quicktime instead. A couple do not convert the files at all. One benefit of those services which do not convert is that the files can be downloaded by others, emailed, etc. QuickTime format can also be downloaded.</p>, <p>One service that has a unique feature is Revver. Much like <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/11/03/insert-ads-into-podcasts-with-fruitcast/"">FruitCast for podcasts</a>, Revver will auto-insert advertisements directly into your videos and share revenue with you.</p>, <p>A couple of additional notes. Grouper has not launched their video publishing product yet. When it does launch there is a good chance it will involve a client download which would remove them from this list. Also, while I’ve noted which services allow tagging of videos, there are a wide variety of tagging options within these services, and many of them also provide comments, rankings, etc. and which are not noted in the chart. Finally, the tools to allow blogging, friends lists and other sharing are varied and more useful in some products than others. Which product is best for you depends on what types of features are most important to you.</p>, <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I’ve updated the chart above with more information. People have left great comments and have included new companies I’ve missed. If you are associated with those companies, please email me relevant information and I’ll include it in the chart. The most interesting comment is from Vinu, who tells us that he heard a rumor that Flickr will be adding video support soon. That would have a significant impact on this market, of course.</p>]"

Etsy is a P2P ecommerce company (like ebay) that currently limits sales to handmade items.

For instance, look at the <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/category_view.php?category_id=10"">“Bags &amp; Purses” category </a>and note the tags (called subcategories) on the right hand side. Click on anyone of these and you go deeper into the taxonomy…although really it is a folksonomy. Further refine items by clicking on additional tags, or on a different set of tags based on materials used to produce the product. The benefit of this folksonomy is that it is user generated and based on popularity. If a new item gets hot fast, the folksonomy will take that into account. It’s a beautiful use of tags and the first launched product I’ve seen that does this.</p>, <p>Etsy also does some amazing things with flash – the geolocator on the home page is a great way to find sellers by location. You can also use their “shop by color” widget…less useful but an interesting feature. Finally, they have a time machine feature, although I can’t figure out what it does.</p>, <p>Nice product.

No other personal information is requested. Adding books is just as easy. So many people are using Library Thing (they recently accounced they had <a href=""http://www.librarything.com/blog/2005/11/new-tag-pages-and-related-tags.php"">1 million tags</a>) now that a simple search on an author or title will most likely pull the book up, which can be added to your catalog with a single click. You can also input ISBNs if you like. Quickly add tags, a rating and a review if you like. It’s fast and easy to add books and metadata.</p>, <p>Library Thing is free for up to 200 books, with a premium service for more books. I love the last sentence in their FAQ for pricing:</p>, <p>At present, a free account allows you to catalog up to 200 books. A paid account allows you to catalog any number of books. Paid accounts cost $10 for a year or $25 for a lifetime. I conservatively predict the revenue will enable me to recline all day on an enormous pile of gold.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Library Thing also just released a <a href=""http://www.librarything.com/blog/2005/11/new-tag-pages-and-related-tags.php"">new feature</a> called “tag info pages” which has lots of information on a given tag. Here’s <a href=""http://www.librarything.com/tag/fiction"">Fiction</a>, for example.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/09/05/organize-your-stuff-with-listal/"">Listal</a> is another company that does this, although Listal also allows information on dvds, games and music. If you are really into books, go with Library Thing. If you have a big collection of all media, go with Listal. And if you have a mac, use <a href=""http://www.delicious-monster.com/"">Delicious Library</a>, which lets you scan books in with a digital camera, saving countless hours.</p>, <p>I have a lot of books. And I move a lot, often to other countries. Moving books sucks and so I’ve moved most of them to my <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelarrington/18578391/in/set-1318821/"">parents</a> house in Washington. Since my parents have are retired and have a lot of time on their hands, I’m hoping to get them to do all of the hard work in uploading the initial book data. Dad, how ’bout it? :-)</p>]"
People Tagging with Tagalag,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.tagalag.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a><a href=""http://www.tagalag.com"">Tagalag</a> is a service that lets you tag <em>people</em>, via their email address. It’s not a “tribute” site like <a href=""http://www.43people.com"">43 people</a>, because only people who know a person’s email address can add tags for that person.</p>, <p>If you create a profile you can add personal and geographical information about yourself.</p>, <p>I don’t know if Tagalag is onto a viable business model, but I like the idea of tagging people. This could become interesting as it evolves.</p>]"
Facebook Users sure are Passionate,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/facebooklogo.png"" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/facebook"">Facebook</a> is on a tear. There are rumors that their total page views will surpass some of the top internet sites in the next few months. 85%+ of all college students us it and 70% of them log in daily.</p>, <p>Somehow a post I wrote on <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/85-of-college-students-use-facebook/"">Facebook back in September</a> is the number two search result on Google for “<a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=facebook&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official"">Facebook</a>” and the post is consistently one of the top three traffic generators for TechCrunch. The result is that the comments section of the post continues to attract college students leaving their thougths.</p>, <p>An <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/85-of-college-students-use-facebook/"">early comment</a> attacked Facebook, saying:</p>, <p>I think that the Facebook is worse than pornography.

Companies I'd like to Profile (but don't exist),"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">There are companies I review every day that I don’t write about. Reasons vary – it’s been done already and the product isn’t even as good as what’s been done, its a mostly or totally one-way application, or it isn’t consumer focused (or have implications for consumer focused applications). Even with this filtering, I get flame comments on some of the stuff I do choose to write about as “not worthy”.</p>, <p>But there are a number of companies and/or products that I would like to write about but don’t exist. I’ve been keeping a list over the last few months and I am posting it now.</p>, <p>Some of these are big ideas, some small. Some could potentially receive venture backing, most wouldn’t. But I believe that a viable business could be built by an entrepreneur around any of these, and I will be happy to profile them if and when someone builds them. In a way, this is number 11 in my previously post “<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/?p=215"">Top Ten Things You Can Do To Get Blogged</a>“, but its also much more than that.</p>, <p>And let me know if and where these should fall in <a href=""http://www.nivi.com/blog/article/the-trillion-dollar-web-20-matrix"">Nivi’s matrix</a>.</p>, <p><big><strong>1. Better and Cheaper Online File Storage</strong></big></p>, <p>Photos, movies, music and important files take up a ton of hard drive space. I recently purchased a new desktop computer with a 250 GB hard drive, and the hard drive is full from recorded television shows that I haven’t watched yet. Yeah, I can buy a network drive for my house, but they are expensive and if the house burns down I’ve still lost everything.</p>, <p>It’s amazing to me that all of us aren’t backing up our important files online regularly. As far as I’m concerned, the only reason is because no product has emerged to fill this tremendous demand, with the right features and at the right price.</p>, <p>We need a good product. Something as easy to use as the Flickr uploader on the client side, and easy web access. These tools need to go a generation or two beyond what xdrive is offering.</p>, <p>Features I’d like to see: drag and drop file adding and removing, an rss feed for my files, tagging of every file for easy search later, easy sharing, and the ability to publish files to the web with permanent URLs. And off location backups in case <em>your</em> building burns down.</p>, <p>Pricing needs to be dramatically lower too. Find a way to make this cheap. Include ads or whatever, but this needs to be very low cost (remember that Google offers over 2 gb of mail storage for free). Xdrive is currently <a href=""http://www.xdrive.com/tryit/plus_pricing.jsp"">$10/month</a> for 5 gigs. Even Godaddy, at <a href=""https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/email/vsdb_landing.asp?se=%2B&amp;app%5Fhdr=&amp;ci=2661"">$10/year</a> for 1 gb, is way too costly.</p>, <p>I have no idea what the cost economics for a business like this are, but plan for scale and give some amount, at least a gig or two, permanently free. No 15 day free trials – we see right through that. Give me a lot for free and let me scale up to, say 500 GB for $20 per year.</p>, <p><big><strong>2. Blog/website Email Lists</strong></big></p>, <p>People can visit my site, and get the content via RSS, but I know of no quality service to allow people to subscribe to my site via email.</p>, <p>I hate to rip on <a href=""http://www.feedblitz.com/"">Feedblitz</a>, which is really the only choice right now, but it sucks. It’s orange. Really ORANGE. I want the look and feel to be TechCrunch, not theirs. I want people to have the option of getting an email every post, every day, or every week.</p>, <p>I also want to know that I and I alone control these email addresses so that they will not under any circumstances be misused. If I change services, I want to have an easy export feature to take these with me (OPML would be nice).</p>, <p>I also want access to real time stats. The number of emails, type of subscription, how often they are opened and what things are being clicked on.</p>, <p>And users need a very easy way to stop the emails.</p>, <p>I’m willing to pay for this. Probably as much as $20 per month. A free version should be offered too that’s add supported and maybe doesn’t have the analytics.</p>, <p>I’m frankly amazed that Feedburner chose to partner with Feedblitz to do this instead of building it themselves. It wouldn’t be that hard to build. And the Feedblitz interface disaster wouldn’t be detracting from the Feedburner brand.</p>, <p><big><strong>3. Portable Reputations</strong></big></p>, <p>eBay’s Feedback system is arguably their biggest asset. Even with its flaws, it is one the biggest drivers of trust between two people buying and selling who’ve never met and never will. But it’s a closed system, usable only within eBay and only for eBay transactions. We need an internet-wide identity and feedback system that any reputable application can tap into, both pulling and pushing data.</p>, <p>A couple of companies have taken tentative steps in this direction, but they have until now kept the data in their own silo, demanding people come to their site to provide feedback. <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/03/ikarma-has-potential-to-be-huge/"">I reviewed iKarma</a>, one of these, in October and practically begged them to change their business model. So far they haven’t. <a href=""http://www.opinity.com"">Opinity</a> is much the same, although they offer partners the opportunity to tap into the data. These centralized data plays have no chance on today’s internet. Why even bother.</p>, <p>Here’s what we need – a referee and a scorekeeper. Open (I didn’t say free, mind you) APIs in and out, not just links to feedback scores. Figure out the rules (keep it flexible) and let other applications feed the database. Somebody please build this. Or eBay, open up your Feedback API.</p>, <p>I’m not alone in pleading for this. See what <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2005/11/are_online_repu.html?campaign_id=rss_blog_blogspotting"">Rob Hof</a> and <a href=""http://www.unionsquareventures.com/2005/11/are_reputations.html"">others</a> have to say as well.</p>, <p><big><strong>4. Tailored Local Offers (via RSS)</strong></big></p>, <p>Build a website. Let users give as much or as little demographic and personal information as they wish. Partner with a big sales force that already has access to local businesses (citisearch, yellow pages, whoever). Offer me (via email, website and RSS) special offers from local merchants. $5 off a pizza. Free first time dry cleaning. A cup of coffee. Whatever. I’ll eat it up (and so will everyone else).</p>, <p><big><strong>5. Facebook, in other countries</strong></big></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.hebig.com/archives/003494.shtml"">Somebody</a>‘s gonna do it. Why not you?</p>, <p><big><strong>6. Free Music</strong></big></p>, <p>Music will someday be legally free. There is just no other way. Artists, label and promoters will need to make money in other ways.</p>, <p>Limited edition cds and dvds. Concerts. Tshirts. Whatever. Face <a href=""http://webreakstuff.com/blog/2005/11/sony-i-download-your-music/"">reality</a> and do it sooner rather than later.</p>, <p><big><strong>7. Open Source Yellow Pages</strong></big></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=44"">YellowWikis</a> is sort of on the right path, but drop the wiki aspect (as I’ve said before, wiki’s are hammers, but not everything is a nail), add tagging and make it open source. Or at least open APIs in and out. Make money from local ads and premium listings.</p>, <p><big><strong>8. Podcast Transcriptions</strong></big></p>, <p>Podcasters need transciptions. Many people don’t have the time or inclination to listen to every podcast they want to. Search engines can’t index the content. Transctiptions fix both problems.</p>, <p>Hire transcribers in a low cost country. Offer podcasters reasonably priced transcriptions (bonus: in multiple languages). I’m thinking $10 per half hour. Partner with the podcast directories, search engines and tool providers. Mint money.</p>, <p><big><strong>9. Decentralized Review Aggregation</strong></big></p>, <p>There are millions of passionate reviews of every product and thing you can think of sitting out there in the blogosphere. Don’t try to get people to <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/11/20/why-i-dont-like-riffs/"">re-write</a> all this stuff. Leverage tagging, RSS and, eventually, microformats to aggregate it and make it searchable/findable. Wonderfully, chaotically decentralized. Ad supported.</p>, <p><big><strong>10. Build Something Cool with SSE</strong></big></p>, <p>Figure out <a href=""http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=54"">how to leverage this</a> before everyone else does and build something beautiful and amazing.</p>, <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href=""http://blogs.zdnet.com/web2explorer/?p=64"">Richard MacManus</a> adds a few ideas of his own.</p>, <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href=""http://www.econometa.com/archives/27"">Adam Marsh</a> adds my startups into Nivi’s/Ethan’s matrix, using numsum.

Like other sites, Newsvine will show major news publications. However, readers can comment on news items, allowing for a discussion to ensue.</p>, <p>They are also adding tagging.

If you are interested in seeing news on a given tag, you can of course go straight to that URL as well.</p>, <p>Newsvine will use a voting system, like Digg, to determine how relevant a given news item is.

A Profile of Tagworld,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.tagworld.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>Santa Monica based <a href=""http://www.tagworld.com"">Tagworld</a> has been quietly beta testing its product for a few months, and officially opened its doors earlier this week. They now have 75,000 members and are growing by thousands per day. The funny thing is that I had never heard of them before last week when I was contacted by Carmen Hughes of <a href=""http://www.ignitepr.com"">ignitepr</a> for a preview.</p>, <p>Tagworld is a huge project. At its core it is a blogging platform, and at first glance it appeared to be a sort of advanced <a href=""http://www.myspace.com"">Myspace</a> or <a href=""http://www.tagged.com"">Tagged</a> – a blogging platform that would ultimately appeal to teens and college students as its core market. But after meeting the founders and getting a first hand look at the deep features, it’s clear that it is more than just the next teen blogging hangout. There are advanced features that will appeal to a much larger audience.</p>, <p>The site is still rough and a number of features are buggy. But given their early subscriber growth, it appears that they are on to something interesting.</p>, <p>Tagworld was founded by <a href=""http://tagworld.com/fred/World/MyWeb.aspx"">Fred Krueger</a> and <a href=""http://tagworld.com/evan/World/MyWeb.aspx"">Evan Rifkin</a>, two serial entrepreneurs who’ve had a string of successful liquidity events. They’ve self funded Tagworld, which is six months old and has 20 employees.</p>, <p>The site is going to try to own just about every web 2.0 experience of its users – blogging, bookmarking, photos and other media files, file storage, and tagging. They say they are going to have open data in and out, meaning if a user is really attached to say, Flickr, they’ll be able to integrate with those photos seemlessly. And they’ll have RSS and APIs to send data out. But their clear goal, as Fred said when we met, is to replace del.icio.us, flickr and blogger (among other services) for its users.</p>, <p>All features are free to users (other than extended file storage); Tagworld makes its money from integrated advertising.</p>, <p>Tagworld has a solid blogging platform that is based on user-included widgets (posts, pictures, tags, friends, media player, maps, etc.). Designing the site is done through an Ajax interfact that allows dragging and dropping for quick organization.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>The platform is based on widget objects. There are a bunch of widgets that have already been included (such as those mentioned in the paragraph above), and there is an API for third parties to create their own and share them on Tagworld.</p>, <p>Blogs are easily customized by users, and more advanced users can take full control of the html as well.</p>, <p>Tagworld has an advanced wysiwyg tool for editing blogs, including adding photos (resizing, positioning) and media files.</p>, <p>A social bookmarking feature is included. They do not yet have a bookmarklet but the core functionality is on the site. Tagworld automatically takes a small screen shot of the page as well and includes it with the bookmark metadata. Bookmarks can be tagged, and shared or kept private. They are also building integration tools with other bookmark services such as del.icio.us.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>Tagworld has a decent tool for uploading photos. There’s a great flash module for showing off photos on the home page.</p>, <p>Uploading media files is also easy, and there is a media player module to play video and audio files on the home page. Fred and Evan say that they will also have flickr integration into and out of tagworld for users who do not want to switch.</p>, <p>They are still ironing out the details on this feature, but Tagworld is allowing a full gig of file storage. These files can be tagged, searched and integrated into the user’s website very easily. Uploaded media files can be played on the home page/blog by integrating it with the player widget.</p>, <p>The first gig is free. They plan to charge “at cost” for additional storage.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Everything on Tagworld can be tagged. People, posts, pictures, media files, other files, etc. Combined with search, it’s a very useful way of finding content.</p>, <p>There are other nice touches as well. Search is well integrated with personal and community tags. RSS will be available soon. And they’ve done some interesting things with Ajax, such as a slider control to increase or decrease the search results shown on a page.</p>, <p>Tagworld is not for everyone, but it may be for the mass consumer that is just starting to jump into web 2.0.</p>, <p>I just checked the site. In the time it took me to write this profile, Tagworld added another 1,500 users. In the end, customer acquisition and monetization is all that really matters.</p>]"

Yahoo Shoposphere Just Launched,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://shopping.yahoo.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a><a href=""http://shopping.yahoo.com/shoposphere"">Yahoo Shoposphere</a> launches tonight (well, officially at 6 am EST tomorrow, but I’ve gotten permission to write about it tonight). I met with Rob Solomon, Yahoo’s GM of Shopping, and Sabrina Crider, a Yahoo PR Manager, last week to take it for a test drive.</p>, <p>Yahoo is making a major push into search personalization and recommendations – the overall project is called “Shoposphere” and the major feature being released is called “<a href=""http://shopping.yahoo.com/shoposphere/"">Pick Lists</a>“. Their goal is to move ecommerce towards what they call “me commerce”. Any registered Yahoo user can create a Pick List.</p>, <p><strong>Get on the Shoposphere…Make a Pick List</strong></p>, <p>Pick Lists let you share the stuff you love and the stuff that matters to you with everyone or your friends… on the Shoposphere, throughout Yahoo! Shopping, by email, and even through RSS feeds.</p>, <p>Make a good one and it could even show up as one of the highest rated Pick Lists on the Shoposphere.</p>, <p><a href=""http://shopping.yahoo.com/mylist.html;_ylt=ArX8iKnXTiilG0l.Vj6PU2OOHcEF;_ylu=X3oDMTBjMGZtMmx1BF9zAzAEc2VjA3RvcA--?user=marrington&amp;listid=scd-3-1132024096""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>Yahoo has allowed users to create “uber lists” of bookmarked shopping items for a few weeks now. Items may be saved to a public or private list. Pick Lists are a subset of these uber lists. A user selects any number of items from the 75+ million unique products in the Yahoo Shopping catalog, names the list, adds ratings and comments for each item, and publishes it to a permanent URL.</p>, <p>My “Web 2.0 Gadgets” Pick List can be <a href=""http://shopping.yahoo.com/mylist.html;_ylt=ArX8iKnXTiilG0l.Vj6PU2OOHcEF;_ylu=X3oDMTBjMGZtMmx1BF9zAzAEc2VjA3RvcA--?user=marrington&amp;listid=scd-3-1132024096"">viewed here</a>. Like the list? Say yes or no and vote on it. Want to leave a comment? Add it at the bottom. Really like it? Subscribe to the RSS!</p>, <p>The more people that vote for a Pick List, the higher it will appear in the Shoposphere.</p>, <p>There are a couple of features being added in the near future. The first is tagging – all lists will be able to be tagged by users and the list creator for easier search (compare this to <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/11/14/amazon-tags/"">Amazon Tags</a>, which I wrote about earlier today).</p>, <p>The second upcoming feature is revenue sharing. Yahoo expects many users to promote their Pick Lists and some will generate significant traffic. Yahoo Shopping earns revenue a number of ways from its shopping platform – clicks to vendors, overture ads, etc. They plan to share some of these revenue streams with Pick List publishers, giving publishers a bigger incentive to publicize these on their websites. Yahoo will provide promotion tools for picklists, similar to the flickr badges seen all over the web.</p>, <p>Yahoo is also hoping to use Pick Lists to promote more long tail items from Yahoo Shopping. While Yahoo will continue to promote various items throughout shopping, they can rely on user generated Pick Lists to push deeper, less known items as well.</p>, <p>Yahoo is also releasing developer APIs to allow mashups with other applications.</p>, <p>Rob Solomon says Pick Lists are just the first major feature of the Shoposphere, and that they will be releasing new consumer driven merchandising soon. For another interesting experiment, check out Yahoo’s <a href=""http://mindset.research.yahoo.com/"">Mindset</a>, an Ajax search interface which allows users to change search results based on whether they are more interested in “research” or “shopping”. It will be interesting to see how all of these features come together.</p>]"

We previously anticipated the launch of Google Base (along with everyone else) in <a href=""http://base.google.com/"">late October</a>.</p>, <p><u>Bottom Line</u>: This is not a very interesting application in its current form. <a href=""http://www.archimedesventures.com/?p=16"">Keith Teare</a> says it’s like a 1985 dBASE file with less functionality. It’s ugly. It’s centralized content with less functionality than ebay or craigslist.

The general idea is that you pick a category for your post. There are suggested categories – course calendars, events and activities, jobs, reviews, wanted ads, etc. You can also create your own category.</p>, <p>Each category has its own fields to ease data input. For instance, the “vehicles” category includes fields for vehicle type, year, make, etc. You fill out any or all of these fields, add additional fields (called “attributes”) if you choose, and add a title, description and keywords (tags). You can also upload a picture or point to a picture on the web.</p>, <p>I found a few bugs in this form.

Hyper-Contextual Search Results with Swicki,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://swicki.eurekster.com/""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>Eurekster’s <a href=""http://swicki.eurekster.com/"">Swicki </a>search service officially launches later today (November 16, 2005).</p>, <p>Eurekster, a twenty person company located in San Francisco and New Zealand, has a profitable business (called Search Publisher) that provides customized search results to a number of large websites. Steven Marder, Eurekster’s CEO, tells me Eurekster’s current products are generating 25+ million monthly searches.</p>, <p>With Swickis, they’ve taken the basic technology and added on a “do it yourself” interface to allow a much larger number of sites, particularly blogs, to also integrate search direclty into their content.</p>, <p>Swicki’s are “community powered” in a sense and their website focuses on this.</p>, <p><strong>What is a swicki?</strong></p>, <p>A swicki is new kind of search engine that allows anyone to create deep, focused searches on topics you care about. Unlike other search engines, you and your community have total control over the results and it uses the wisdom of crowds to improve search results. This search engine, or swicki, can be published on your site. Your swicki presents search results that you’re interested in, pulls in new relevant information as it is indexed, and organizes everything for you in a neat little customizable widget you can put on your web site or blog, complete with its very own buzz cloud that constantly updates to show you what are hot search terms in your community.</p>, <p>And certainly the community has a role in creating more relevant results. But what really interests me about their technology is that the tweaking by the publisher along with community actions combine to create extremely contextual, or hyper-contextual (my words, not theirs), search results.</p>, <p>Two somewhat different examples of live Swickis (they’ve been in private beta for a while): see our <a href=""http://www.web20workgroup.com/"">Web 2.0 Workgroup</a> (scroll down a bit) and <a href=""http://blog.softtechvc.com/"">Jeff Clavier</a>‘s right sidebar.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Swicki’s are based on Yahoo’s search API for base results. The publisher customizes the search engine by adding keywords that are always added to the search results. And, in a similar way to <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/09/28/rollyo-search-launches-today/"">Rollyo</a>, Swickis allow for the publisher to name specific websites that have content relevant to the search. For instance, a gaming site may include other gaming website URLs as important, and Swicki will put results from those sites on the top. A publisher can also block results from certain blogs. For our<a href=""http://www.web20workgroup.com""> Workgroup</a>, we selected all participating site URLs as the most relevant content.</p>, <p>Swicki’s also have a related “buzzcloud”, which is a tagcloud of commonly searched terms. The buzzcould can also be edited by the publisher to add or remove terms, and a spam filter disallows any single IP from influencing the buzzcloud results too heavily.</p>, <p>Swickis are completely free. They will soon have contextual advertising served along with normal search results if the publisher chooses, but there will be no penalty or fee if they publisher wishes to keep advertising out. They are also adding analytics to allow publishers to monitor search statistics.</p>, <p>A <a href=""http://www.eurekster.com/about/newsroom"">press release</a> should be out soon and I’ll link to it once it’s available. Check out their <a href=""http://blog.eurekster.com/"">blog</a> as well for a post.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.solutionwatch.com/263/eurekster-swickis-community-powered-search/"">Brian Benzinger</a> posted a long review of Swickis last month when they first went into private beta.

Is the Gawker-Yahoo Deal Important?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.gawker.com/"">Gawker</a>, a blog network similar to Weblogs, Inc., and Yahoo <a href=""http://today.reuters.co.uk/News/NewsArticle.aspx?type=internetNews&amp;storyID=2005-11-16T052418Z_01_KWA619348_RTRIDST_0_OUKIN-UK-MEDIA-YAHOO-GAWKER.XML"">announced</a> a syndication deal today that brings Gawker content to<a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/""> Yahoo News</a>. Content from the largest Gawker blogs is already included – Wonkette, Gizmodo, Defamer, Lifehacker, and Gawker itself. More may be coming.</p>, <p>The financial terms are undisclosed, but here’s what is now on Yahoo: Gawker brands and content are pushed throughout the <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/"">news home page</a>. Clicking on associated content pulls up a Yahoo page with the Gawker content (<a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/s/lifehacker/20051117/tc_lifehacker/howtomeditate;_ylt=AseqJYzJDq.ln0QXLpCwx6Ks0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA3cjE0b2MwBHNlYwM3Mzg-"">example</a>). It does NOT redirect to Gawker.</p>, <p>There is a single link to Gawker on the content page (clicking on the brand name). Otherwise, it’s an all-Yahoo experience. If I was doing the deal, I’d expect a revenue split in Yahoo’s favor on ad revenue generated from the page. Gawker gets that revenue, the branding, and some links directly to the blog. This is purely speculation, but my best guess.</p>, <p><a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/s/lifehacker/20051117/tc_lifehacker/howtomeditate;_ylt=AqM72a.1Pdd1eVZOipwXV2qs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA3cjE0b2MwBHNlYwM3Mzg-""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>Is this an important deal? Yes, in that it shows Yahoo embracing blog content. The guy at Yahoo to get to know is clearly Scott Moore, named by Wired in their last print edition as VP Content Operations. Scott is hiring bloggers (such as Kevin Sites) and doing these kinds of deals with Gawker. These are smart deals for Yahoo – they generate page views where they can put lots of ads. If the deals are revenue share, then it’s a no lose proposition for Yahoo.</p>, <p>But what Yahoo is noticeably <u>not</u> doing is acquiring Gawker, like <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/05/aol-acquires-weblog-inc/"">AOL did with Weblogs, Inc.</a> That means liquidity events for bloggers are limited – the GYMs (Google-Yahoo-Microsoft) are not yet in content buying moods.</p>, <p>So perhaps the networks and very large blogs can cut deals to increase page views on content and generate revenue. Will this model work for the long or medium tail of blog content? My guess is no…the GYMs will want to control quality and that doesn’t scale with more than a small number of blogs. But certainly we’ll see more deals like this, particularly as long as the advertising market is strong and demand for inventory is outstripping supply. The portals need content, and this is a cheap way to get it.</p>, <p>A lot of people are focusing on the fact that the deal is incorporating  blog content directly into Yahoo news results. While I find this interesting, we’ve already seen Yahoo experiment with this with their <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/10/yahoo-blog-search/"">blog search product</a>. Clearly Yahoo is defining the definition of news to include blogs (as they should), and I applaud this.</p>, <p>But back to the title of this post. Is it an interesting deal? Yes, but mostly because of what the deal <u>isn’t</u> – it isn’t an aquisition of Gawker.</p>, <p>Read more analysis of the deal at <a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/002942.php"">Read/Write Web</a>, <a href=""http://www.paidcontent.org/pc/arch/2005_11_16.shtml#052417"">Paid Content</a> and <a href=""http://tech.memeorandum.com/051116/p41#a051116p41"">Memeorandum</a>.</p>]"

It is a rumor, however, that has been confirmed to me by employees of companies that were also apparently in the hunt for Riya but dropped out after the price became too rich.</p>, <p>These rumors will certainly make <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/11/10/techcrunch-meetup-4-riya-launch-party/"">Riya’s launch party at my house</a> tomorrow night even more interesting.</p>, <p>I want to stress that even though I know the Riya folks and even though I am hosting their launch party, I have no direct confirmation of the deal from them (and yes, I’ve tried).

Advertising on TechCrunch,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">As many of you know, writing TechCrunch is and has been a hobby/obsession of mine for over 5 months now.

The main reason I’ve done this is to associate with these other blogs and cross pollinate ideas. Another benefit of the network is that they seek out appropriate advertisers for blogs.</p>, <p>As part of my commitment to FM Publishing I’ll be placing some ads on TechCrunch.

Why I don't like Riffs,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.riffs.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a><a href=""http://www.riffs.com"">Riffs</a>, a review site for anything, launched quietly last week.</p>, <p>It  takes a hybrid wiki/social bookmarking approach. Any user can add a URL to begin a discussion (or just begin a discussion without a URL), and the Riffs community votes on the thing and discusses it in wiki fashion. All pages have RSS and the clean interface has some great Ajax features. Riffs also has tagging, including “common tags”, which I think is interesting.</p>, <p>So why don’t I like it?</p>, <p>It’s centralized content. All of the content resides on Riff’s servers and they require people to go to the site (in one way or another) to add content to the discussion. And in this case it seems absolutely crazy to architect their service this way.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Reviews are everywhere on the web today. And the most exciting place to find reviews in on blogs. Try it – search on “whatever” and “review” and you’ll see thousands upon thousands of high quality reviews on just about anything all over the blogosphere.</p>, <p>Riffs approach is to try to get in the middle and generate a centralized discussion by people who want to talk about a subject. They are staying as open as possible by creating RSS feeds for each page, and my understanding is that they may be creating tools to allow people to push the content they create at Riffs out to their blog, like flickr does.</p>, <p>And it seems to me this is their core mission – to become the flickr of reviews. Not “flickr” in the joking way that everyone says when something is trying to be the cool new web 2.0 application, but literally, the place people put their review content and then pull it out for their blog if they choose to do so.</p>, <p><a href=""http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/11/living_on_the_e.html"">Fred Wilson</a> writes about the service and addresses points similar to those above that I made on <a href=""http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=50"">CrunchNotes</a> and<a href=""http://www.buzzmachine.com/index.php/2005/11/20/riff-raff/""> Jeff Jarvis</a> made on his blog.</p>, <p>Jeff and my point: Blogs are the place to write content. Microformats and tagging will help people do this. My additional point: And they already are doing it, at massive scale.</p>, <p>Fred’s retort::</p>, <p>But as a content creator living on the edge, I am not sure we are ready for microformats and tags and social interaction to do all the work for us.  We’ll get there, I am sure of that, but we need an interim step and that step are services that feel centralized but are really application specific edge feeders.  I need a better word for these services, but for now I’ll call them the edge feeders.</p>, <p>I disagree with Fred on this. Flickr is a useful “edge feeder” because it has tools for managing photos that go way beyond what most bloggers have. And more importantly, they host the pictures for you at no cost.</p>, <p>Reviews are different. They are easy to write, easy to publish and cost very little to host. What we need is a service that takes all of this great content out there and pulls it into a centralized place for search and find (and further discussion), but which always points people back to the original post.</p>, <p>Back to Riffs, I really do like the wiki/communit aspect of the service. But they need to find a way to grab their data from the edge first and foremost. If they can do interesting things with it, then they can be successful.</p>, <p>I know why they aren’t doing this. All that open data out there…anyone can take it. If Riffs is successful with my suggested approach, what stops others from doing the same?</p>, <p>My answer? Absolutely nothing. But their current approach doesn’t even put them in the game. I say find a way to aggregate that data and relate it into a discussion somehow, like Memeorandum does on a smaller scale. Then you’ve got a big company.</p>, <p>But you better hurry up. <a href=""http://blogcritics.org/"">Some guys are already circling the wagons</a>.</p>]"

RSS is Now Integrated into Yahoo Mail and Alerts,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Yahoo gathered a small group of bloggers, press and others at Sauce in San Francisco tonight to announce the launch of two new RSS products. They have integrated an RSS reader directly into <a href=""http://mail.yahoo.com"">Yahoo Mail</a> Beta, and are expanding <a href=""http://alerts.yahoo.com"">Alerts</a> to include RSS feeds.</p>, <p>These are significant new products, aimed squarely at new and mainstream RSS users. The service is not live as of the time I am posting this. I’ve added a screen shot picture from the live demo.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Yahoo has deeply integrated RSS into the Yahoo Mail beta experience. Directly below the email folders are “RSS folders”. Clicking on the top folder show all posts in a “river of news” format, meaning all posts for all subscribed feeds are listed in the order they have appeared in feeds.</p>, <p>Each feed also has its own folder, allowing the user to read feeds individually (more like bloglines).</p>, <p>A post from any feed is treated exactly like an email – any post can be forwarded as an email or dragged into a folder and saved. All of the great AJAX functionality already working in Yahoo’s Mail beta works with the new RSS functionality as well.</p>, <p>Adding feeds is straightforward – include the feed URL or choose from a number of popular feeds.</p>, <p>Yahoo users can now use Yahoo Alerts to be notified whenever RSS feeds update.  Alerts, which include a summary of the updated content, can be configured to be sent via sms, email and/or messenger. This is a great way to monitor small groups of important feeds.</p>, <p>Yahoo clearly took the lead for best email application this evening. The ability to “pop in” other email accounts, the ajax functionality and, now, the integrated RSS reader are absolutely stunning features.</p>, <p>John Furrier was at the event tonight as well, and as usual has an <a href=""http://www.podtech.net/?p=229"">exclusive podcast</a>.</p>, <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> RSS in Yahoo Mail is now fully live. As <a href=""http://blog.softtechvc.com"">Jeff Clavier</a> says, My Yahoo and Yahoo Mail syncronize feeds – a long list in email doesn’t work so well in My Yahoo. I spoke to Scott Gatz at Yahoo about this earlier this evening and he says they’ll find a fix for it. There are a few other features which still need to be added, but Yahoo Mail is just an incredibly awesome product.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/11/yahoorssmail1.jpg""/></p>]"

A free version of the product is also available, although it has extremely limited functionality (no online storage, for example).</p>, <p>I’ve registered and have paid for the premium product. Music syncing is accomplished via a downloaded application (windown, mac and linux), and it is going to take forever. I have somewhere around 10,000 songs – and they upload at a rate of 200 songs per hour. That means I’ll be uploading for about 50 hours.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Once the songs are uploaded, I’ll write more about how Oboe works.

The FAQs do state, however, <em>“Just a few mouse clicks will ensure you never lose your music.

Oboe is his latest attempt at allowing users to access their music online. Previously, MP3.com offered a service called Beam-It which allowed users to verify that they owned a cd by inserting it into their computer, and were subsequently able to access that music directly from the web.</p>, <p>MP3Tunes is hoping to avoid the fate of Beam-It by acting as a service provider only and assuming that users legally own the music they upload. The <a href=""http://www.copyright.gov/onlinesp/"">Digital Millenium Copyright Act</a> provides limitations on service provider liability “with respect to information residing, at direction of a user, on a system or network that the service provider controls or operates”.</p>, <p>I hope they win this one.</p>, <p>Via <a href=""http://digitalmusic.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000263070731/"">Brad Hill</a>.</p>, <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I left the syncer on all night.

This change alone makes Inform a much more interesting and useful service.</p>, <p>Other significant changes include the addition of audio and video content to the site, a subject filter that offers related content and which works quite well, and the addition of RSS feeds for search results. Finally, the “top channels” tab now allows drill down into sub-topics, which were not available before.</p>, <p>Overall, Inform is an excellent resource and continues to improve dramatically.

More important, you now have total control over the material. From the moment you upload a file to Glide, it’s converted into an online preview. Your visitors can listen to one of your songs or watch one of your videos, but they can’t download it, keep it, or even replay it without returning to the Web site.</p>, <p>As a result, you can limit how many times somebody plays or watches something, or specify a window of opportunity (say, Dec. 5 to 20) for people’s access. You can even play Big Brother by tracking how many times each person has viewed or played a certain goody.</p>, <p>With just a few clicks, you can also publish one of your containers as either a Web page, complete with embedded pictures and videos, or a blog entry. It’s almost automatic, although you have no control whatsoever over the layout of the result.</p>, <p>All of this is fun to use, thanks to a full-blown online operating system that Glide designed itself. After all, thought TransMedia, why make the site look like Windows or Mac OS X, when a custom design could be simpler and better tailored to Glide’s functions?</p>, <p>In the Glide OS, each object on the screen – thumbnails, containers and so on – bears a tiny “badge” that resembles a pie chart. When you point to it, a round menu sprouts at your cursor tip. It lists commands pertaining to that object (Delete, Edit or Publish, for example), arrayed like colorful slices of a pizza.</p>, <p>I spent some considerable time this evening trying to get my arms around this rather large project, but gave up before I was even able to finish registration.</p>, <p>The home page is a complete mess. This is the first impression a company gives to new potential customers, and Glide decided to pack everything in with <a href=""http://www.glidedigital.com/"">2,604 total words</a>. It’s a damn magnum opus that describes everything Glide was, is and will become, without ever really getting to the point.</p>, <p>Registration is a train wreck. There is a free account option, but every registration requires a full name and home address. I entered that, but gave up when it required a credit card to be put on file, even though I was just trying to test the free account. I understand that Glide wants “real” customers since even the free account comes with 150 mb of storage, but this was just too much to ask of a new customer.</p>, <p>I sighed, left the computer and drank a glass of wine. I decided to try again. I re-started registration, but the “techcrunch” username was now “taken” due to my previous attempt. And there is no way to resume my previous registration. Requesting a password reset failed. The name was reserved but wasn’t an active account.</p>, <p>I could try again with a different user name, but honestly, since 99% of users will also have given up after seeing the home page design and refusing to give up all of this personal information, what’s the point?

Each piece of content can be shared with the public, kept private or shared just with a select group of people.</p>, <p>The publisher can also tag content for easy search/find later. And RSS feeds are availble for tags and publishers.</p>, <p>Grouper is a Windows XP based application that allows users to share their personal media with the world and/or safely within private groups. With Grouper users can upload video and photo previews to Grouper.com where anyone can view them and then choose to download them via our distributed download network. Grouper also uses P2P technology to connect you directly to your friends’ hard drives where they can share large media files in a safe, encrypted environment. Grouper is a simple install and requires no firewall reconfiguration.</p>, <p>A key feature is the ability to create your own “Groovies”, or movies. This is a set of tools which allows users to mash up various video clips, photos and music/audio, along with title pages. These basic tools, all free, give users the power to create really cool videos on the fly and share them with others.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Based on the name, I suspected that Grouper was saving them in a proprietary format that could only be viewed on their website or via their client, but there is an option to download and share these files in WMV format. This is absolutely awesome.</p>, <p>I feel as though I’ve only touched the surfact of Grouper, and I’m going to continue to test the product. They just may have set the new standard for video sharing on the web (at least for the windows platform).</p>]"

Wall Street Journal Discusses the Rise of Bloggers,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB113391812858915737-PdGY3flRpneCpyQcsjOc_Ng4Doc_20061206.html?mod=rss_free"">Lee Gomes</a> wrote about Memeorandum, Blogniscient and TechCrunch in the Wall Street Journal today. It’s an interesting column discussing the rise of blogs as “journalists” and the usefullness of blog aggregators in filtering out the most important writing.</p>, <p>The reality is that while there are now as many tech blogs as stars in the sky, only a tiny fraction of them matter. And those that do aren’t part of some proletarian information revolution, but instead have become the tech world’s new elite. Reporters for the big mainstream newspapers and magazines, long accustomed to fawning treatment at corporate events, now show up and find that the best seats often go to the A-list bloggers. And living at the front of the velvet rope line means the big bloggers are frequently pitched and wooed. In fact, with the influence peddling universe in this state of flux, it’s not uncommon for mainstream reporters, including the occasional technology columnist, to lobby bloggers to include links to their print articles.</p>, <p>While I agree with the trend that Lee Gomes is highlighting, I also think there is something even bigger going on. I agree with <a href=""http://www.scripting.com/2005/12/07.html#When:7:22:15AM"">Dave Winer when he says</a>:</p>, <p>There’s more going on here than the reporters being replaced by bloggers. It’s disintermediation, the thing that the Internet does to every business, art and profession that aggregates and repackages. Carl Sagan said that human beings are the cosmos gaining consciousness and studying itself. The tech bloggers are the tech community, the programmers, lawyers, investors, business managers, users, taking responsibility for their own cosmos. The reporters were necessary when you needed a million dollars to start a news “paper,” then a billion dollars to start a media empire. Now you need a laptop computer and an account on Blogger or MSN Spaces.</p>, <p>Bloggers take friction out of the news reporting process. No editors are around to slow down the process. There are also no fact checkers, which can cause problems. However, the blogosphere tends to correct for this, and, as an ecosystem, I’d wager the blogosphere gets more things right than journalists.</p>, <p>Anyway, it is an interesting article. Lee Gomes is one of the guys who gets it, obviously. And I just bought every print copy of the ‘Journal at the local newsstand. :-)</p>]"

I also consider many of the Feedburner guys friends. Even <a href=""http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/team#dick"">Dick Costolo</a>, the CEO, has helped me personally with some issues in the past. In short, I support Feedburner.</p>, <p>Yesterday Feeburner <a href=""http://www.burningdoor.com/feedburner/archives/001541.html"">announced</a> some new features on the RSS Feed landing page that are designed to make the user experience a step better than before.

All good stuff. <a href=""http://www.somewhatfrank.com/2005/12/feedburner_impr.html"">Frank Gruber</a> writes about this on his blog as well in glowing terms, and in general I agree with him – these are nice features.</p>, <p><a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/Techcrunch""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>In looking at the new <a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/Techcrunch"">feed landing page</a> I noticed something that I hadn’t noticed before. An advertisement.</p>, <p>It’s just a single line of text – “Download a Free Trial of FeedDemon 1.5”, with a link that begins a download of FeedDemon. I don’t know if it was there before or if this is a recent addition, but I don’t like it. This page should be all about getting new subscribers to the publisher’s feed, not generating revenue for Feedburner. And particularly if the publisher is a paying “pro” member.</p>, <p>It’s just one ad now, but this is a slippery slope. Publishers invest a lot when they decide to go with Feedburner – they turn their feed URL over to them and it’s not trivial to switch away. Feedburner, perhaps more than most web 2.0 companies, needs to be very careful with trust issues.</p>]"

In this case, Yahoo Answers requries you to categorize your question under a single pre-defined category, and then choose further pre-defined sub categories.</p>, <p>While this certainly helps structure the data for easier search, it isn’t very useful to the publisher. It would be so much easier if, like Flickr, the person asking the question could tag it with a few descriptive terms. They have an incentive to get it right, and Yahoo would quickly have rich enough data to create a virtual category on the fly as users search or browse through the listings.</p>, <p>Making this a free, community-driven service takes it way beyond Google answers. Take the next step:  ditch this impossible to maintain category system and move to tagging and dynamic, on-the-fly taxonomy.</p>]"

Sites like MySpace, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/11/09/facebook-users-are-passionate/"">FaceBook</a> and Xanga are generating a truly massive number of page views – MySpace and FaceBook each rival Google in page views (although they don’t approach the reach). The reason?  These users spend most of their day on these sites, updating their sites and clicking on friends.</p>, <p>TagWorld <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/11/11/a-profile-of-tagworld/"">already had an impressive feature set</a> that includes a GB of storage and great ajax tools for creating a site. And, as the name implies, tagging of everything.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>The new music functionality is a full generation ahead of MySpace and others. Bands can upload a GB of music  and have a number of DRM options to control distrubution. Users can mix this music into their own media player and can upload their own music (and other files, like photos and movies) as well. They can create customized music playlists, store the music on TagWorld and have access to it anywhere they can get online. Users can also set up playlists that others can listen to when they visit the user’s website. All of this requires nothing but the ability to click on the music and drag the music player modue onto their site. No HTML or other technical skills are needed.</p>, <p>Can TagWorld take on MySpace and become the King of <a href=""http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2005/001226.html"">Social Networks 3.0</a>?</p>, <p>Yeah, I think they will. For a number of reasons.</p>, <p>First, the founders, Fred Krueger and Evan Rifkin, have done a great job getting top bands to start using the platform. Check out the TagWorld pages for <a href=""http://www.tagworld.com/deathcabforcutie"">Death Cab For Cutie</a>, <a href=""http://www.tagworld.com/theshins"">The Shins</a> and <a href=""http://www.tagworld.com/thepostalservice"">The Postal Service</a>.</p>, <p>Second, TagWorld has 160,000+ users after just a month of being live. The “in” crowd is starting to notice.</p>, <p>Third, I think the teenager/student social network doesn’t have the same lock-in that, say, ebay has. TagWorld’s target users are fickle and don’t want to be considered mainstream. They’ll try new things and if the functionality is there, they’ll stay. And this target market is constantly renewing itself as children become teenagers (new customers) and young adults move on to more professional tools (customers leave).</p>, <p>So, in a nutshell, I’m bullish on TagWorld. And some of these features quite frankly appeal to a much larger audience than teenagers and young adults. The market for an online music locker with a portable player is wide open. TagWorld can take this market.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/12/tagworldmusic2.jpg""/></p>]"

Try <a href=""http://www.opinmind.com/search.jsp?q=google+vs.+yahoo"">Google vs. Yahoo</a> (Google nudges out Yahoo with a 73% v. 55% approval rating – I wonder if that will change much over time) .

Find out what bloggers are saying right now on any topic, organized by how many links their posts are getting. Think of it as a newspaper front page for any subject. Give it a try!</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>Explore is broken out into multiple categories, including Business, Fashion, Gadgets, Tech and many more. A quick look at <a href=""http://kitchen.technorati.com/explore/tech"">Tech shows a very Memeorandum-like interface</a>.</p>, <p>Posts are listed according to links in (just like Memeorandum), and links are clustered underneath the headline (just like Memeorandum). Technorati Explore is a really interesting way to see how popular blog conversations are clustering (just like Memeorandum).</p>, <p><strong>Here’s what Explore doesn’t do as well as Memeorandum:</strong> It’s nowhere near as real-time as Memeorandum (although Technorati is indexing the entire blogosphere whereas Memeorandum only indexes a few thousand blogs).  Also, Memeorandum is advanced enough to cluster related items even when they don’t necessarily link to eachother – Technorati doesn’t do this. Finally, Memeorandum includes news items (NYT, etc.) and press releases as headlines, which Technorati isn’t doing.<br/>
<strong><br/>
Here’s what it does better than Memeorandum:</strong> It works for any tag – just search on http://kitchen.technorati.com/explore/[TAGNAME], whereas Memeorandum today only has sites for politics and technology. Also, Technorati automatically includes all blogs in the conversaiton, whereas Memeorandum only includes its few thousand indexed blogs. With Technorati, even the smaller bloggers can get in on the conversation.</p>, <p>This is not as addictive as Memeorandum.

BearHug Camp is here,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">Friday, September 12 at 9 am, BearHug Camp begins. The brainchild of Dave Winer, BearHug is based on a tactic Winer used to great effect in bootstrapping coincident work by Netscape and Winer into what we now know as RSS. Recently, we’ve seen the emergence of similar strategies in the so-called micro-blogging segment that has grown around Twitter.</p>, <p>Enterprise micro-blogging service Yammer’s choice as the <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2008/09/10/yammer-takes-techcrunch50s-top-prize/"">best startup</a> at Mike Arrington and Jason Calacanis’ TC50 conference illustrates how far we’ve come in recognizing the power of Twitter-like services, and also how early this all is. BearHug Camp is designed to aggregate as many of these small and large players in one room, to identify the points of common ground and establish some rules of the road. Representatives include those from Twitter, Identi.ca, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, FriendFeed, Mozilla, Seesmic/Twhirl and a number of lesser-known but potentially disruptive engineers and entrepreneurs.</p>, <p>I’m especially encouraged by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s participation, coming as it does on the heels of Twitter’s stability through the conventions of both parties, a small Bay Area earthquake, and at least two major hurricanes. The firestorm over Sarah Palin’s nomination as McCain’s running mate continues unabated, and the conversation has returned to robust pre-May levels on Twitter, with the unfortunate continued loss of Track services. The apparent righting of Twitter’s ship of state, however, augurs for some interesting possibilities when Dorsey takes Twitter’s seat at the table for whatever he time he can give us.</p>, <p>Over on the open source Identi.ca network, Evan Prodromou has been working to solve many of the XMPP reliability problems that seemed so central to Twitter’s early meltdown. Though the scale of Identi.ca and related Laconica instances is dwarfed by the pioneering service, the conversation has become authoritative at a more engineering-focused level, around the process and politics of achieving enough scale to attract a wider, more general-focus audience. Federation services, though touted as the end game for achieving a scalable architecture without the need for massive capital investment, are immature and largely one-way at this point. But the success at building new clouds such as Leo Laporte’s TWiTArmy Laconica instance virtually overnight also augurs for some interesting dynamics at BearHug.</p>, <p>I hesitate to use the word “summit” in regard to this first of what I hope will be ongoing gatherings. First, Tim O’Reilly’s use of that term in organizing “summits” in a number of areas has always struck me as potentially exclusionary, much in the way that FOO Camp, although a wonderful experience for any who have been invited, also tends to make those not invited feel like they’ve been deemed not important or connected enough to have a say in the topic of the day. Also, attempts at negotiating standards are undermined when conducted behind closed doors, no matter how authoritative the guest list.</p>, <p>That’s why BearHug Camp is wide open and transparent. Everything will be broadcast live on the Net. I’ve even foregone using a wiki or event service (though several have been implemented by others), opting instead for using the very network we are talking about to announce confirmations and other details as they come together. The realtime nature of XMPP, track, and cross-domain bridging makes it relatively easy to find out what is going on, and the chat and live-blogging services that will spring up around the streamcast will further amplify the ripple effects of the event.</p>, <p>I really have no idea what to expect of this. I certainly have my own agenda, namely to encourage, cajole, and otherwise use my passion and commitment to this powerful realtime service to effect a rapid adoption of core best practices that allows all comers to participate in a level playing field. To do that, we must respect both the investment of the original creators, the power of open source community contributions, and the amazingly low barrier to entry of obtaining entrance to the party.</p>, <p>Who of us would have believed Bill Gates when, at the height of Microsoft’s dominance of pernsoal computing, he said that his position could be usurped at any moment by a smart, swift competitor. Yet that is exactly what happened. So too is that possible today, if in fact even more opportunistically viral than the last transition. Pull up a seat at BearHug and let’s see what happens.</p>]"

The components, which include some source code, are being released under a very liberal <a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/talk/license.html"">license</a> allowing for free incorporation into commercial and non-commercial software.</p>, <p>We are releasing this source code as part of our ongoing commitment to promoting consumer choice and interoperability in Internet-based real-time-communications. The Google source code is made available under a Berkeley-style license, which means you are free to incorporate it into commercial and non-commercial software and distribute it.</p>, <p>In addition to enabling interoperability with Google Talk, there are several general purpose components in the library such as the P2P stack which can be used to build a variety of communication and collaboration applications. We are eager to see the many innovative applications the community will build with this technology.</p>, <p>Below is a summary of the individual components of the library. You can use any or all of these components.</p>, <p>    * base – Low-level portable utility functions.<br/>
    * p2p – The p2p stack, including base p2p functionality and client hooks into XMPP.<br/>
    * session – Phone call signaling.<br/>
    * third_party – Non-Google components required for some functionality.<br/>
    * xmllite – XML parser.<br/>
    * xmpp – XMPP engine.</p>, <p>Google has done a great job with spurring Google Maps mashups – some people claim hundreds of thousands of third party applications. This code release is even more important and is a huge end around Skype. In fact, Google has basically put a gun to Skype’s head and demanded they now release their API as well.</p>, <p>Skype allows integration with the Skype <strong>client</strong>. What Google has done goes far beyond this, allowing integration with the Google Talk’s VOIP <strong>network</strong>.</p>, <p>Here’s an example of a potential mashup – putting google map location information in the same application as google talk, allowing mapping of everyone in the conversation (<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/07/01/profile-gizmo/"">Gizmo</a> does this).

Bookmarked/tagged results appear above normal search.</p>, <p>Search results can be bookmarked, tagged and rated from Wink. The same functionality is available via a bookmarklet that works with Firefox, Safari and IE. As a twist, users can also block “bad” pages. Lots of functional Ajax is built into the interface.</p>, <p>Users can easily browse tag results (either their own, or all users).</p>, <p>There are three key additional features.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>First, Wink has added two way synchronization with del.icio.us bookmarks. And they’ve added a “Keep Sync’d” feature that, as the name implies, maintains a constant one or two-way syncronization with del.icio.us. No word on whether they will add in other social bookmarking services over time or not.</p>, <p>Second, Wink allows the creation of “collections”, which is a tag group (tags of tags). Collections are controlled by one user but can be shared with anyone.</p>, <p>Third, and this feature really appeals to me, Wink has added a “Wink Answers” tab to search results. The text is a wiki – meaning anyone can edit it. For queries that have complicated results, a number of options appear. A lot of data has been pre-populated, and I believe this will be a popular feature. Like Wikipedia, it begs for user interaction, but with a lower intimidation factor.</p>, <p>Wink is also finalizing a nice blog widget that includes additional links (that point only to bookmarks created by the blogger).

Register your site now to start collecting your share of Gravee’s ad revenue.</p>, <p>Gravee also shares up to 35% of revenue with publisers that join their affiliate program and place their search box on their site. This will be an interesting way of driving traffic to their site.</p>, <p>Site claiming is done via whois information – meaning you must be in control of your domain name to claim the blog. Another way for them to accomplish this would be to ask the site owner to put a piece of code on her/his site, which I imagine they will add at some point.</p>]"

Chris gives a passionate, if not entirely fact laden, speach on what the hell they are trying to accomplish over at Flock.</p>, <p>But no, see, that’s where Flock comes in. Or I don’t care, don’t call it Flock. Whatever you want, but that’s where the thing we’re building comes in. That’s why we exist, that’s why we matter, that’s what the point is.</p>, <p>Yeah, Firefox and Duct tape, it’ll help. Sure sure. It’ll get you some of the way there. But hell, when I’m talking to someone, engaged in a conversation that threatens my very existence, or that threatens to change the way I flip my omelettes, man, I do not want my mouth to fall off at the jaw because it wasn’t tested, wasn’t built right, didn’t have a million beedy eyes boring down on it while it was being fastened to my head, making sure the stupid thing would function in the real world without needing pliers or a tireiron to get it to work right.</p>, <p>My last post on Flock, covering its beta launch, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/20/flock-is-launching-publicly-today/"">is here</a>.</p>, <p>Disclaimer: I like Flock and the Flock employees.

This was previously a multi step process. Since Technorati and other blog search engines view categories as synonyms to tags, this is a quick way for most users to quickly and easily tag their posts without adding additional code.</p>, <p>Another big improvement is the enhanced “view post preview” function. This shows the post exactly as it will look on the blog, with all formatting and CSS that will be applied. This is a welcome feature.</p>, <p>They’ve also added a wysiwyg rich text editor. I disabled this immediately, although many users will like it.</p>, <p>Now for the bad. The new image uploader is a train wreck. Yes, they’ve moved it to the post page which removes a click.

The reason? This is a product that I and millions of others really <em>need</em> – a pure and functional online storage product with key web 2.0 features. Omnidrive is based in Australia, but is as good or better than anything else I’ve seen out of silicon valley recently. It has been in development for 12 months.</p>, <p><big><strong>Access &amp; Features</strong></big></p>, <p><img alt=""""/>Users have two ways to upload, view and interact with files.</p>, <p>The first is a web interface that allows for fairly easy file uploading. Users have three main folder options to start – private, shared and public. By placing a file in the shared folder, other people you’ve allowed in can see and download the file. If placed in the public folder, everyone can access the file.</p>, <p>Omnidrive is also releasing a toolbar to assist with the web interface.</p>, <p><img alt=""""/>The second way to access files is via a download (they support PC and Mac now, pocket PC later) that creates a virtual Omnidrive drive. This is THE way to upload or download big batches of files at once.

They face storage and, more importantly, bandwidth costs that can be significant on a per user basis. In a post I <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/11/21/companies-id-like-to-profile-but-dont-exist/"">wrote</a> back in November (when I first heard of Omnidrive), I wrote that these services needed to give some storage for free, and “lots” for cheap. Founder <a href=""http://www.nik.com.au/archives/2005/12/11/the-economics-of-online-storage/"">Nik Cubrilovic responded</a> in a post that my pricing needs were crazy, but agreed that there needs to be a compelling price point to get mass user adoption.</p>, <p>Their current pricing reflects this thinking. They will give a gig or two of storage for free, and sell 10 gb bundles above that for “not more than” $70 per year. That’s pricy, but way below the industry standard right now.</p>, <p>And of course there will have to be bandwidth throttles. Since files can be public, outgoing bandwidth can be a massive cost for them.</p>, <p><big><strong>Pricing</strong></big></p>, <p>I’m saying this flat-out. Omnidrive is in a position to dominate a market with tremendous pent up demand. I’ve looked at a number of competing services and no one is doing anything close to what they are in functionality and usability.</p>, <p>This service, or a white label version of it, should be built in to every new computer and operating system, and many web applications. With an appropriate API in and out, and rock-bottom pricing, Omnidrive can own a very large market niche.</p>, <p>The cost problem is not trivial, and for a self funded startup taking an up front cost with the promise of long-term customer loyalty is difficult to say the least.

T-Mobile Invests in 3G Spectrum,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""left"" height=""213"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/t-mobile-card.jpg"" style=""float:left;"" width=""280""/><a href=""http://crunchgear.com/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&amp;post=1018"">CrunchGear is reporting</a> that T-Mobile just won 120 licenses on the 3G-compatable spectrum in <a href=""http://wireless.fcc.gov/auctions/default.htm?job=auction_summary&amp;id=66"">this month’s FCC auction</a>. That doesn’t just mean that they’re now able to roll out their nacient 3G network, but rather that they can roll it out their way,  without being hamstringed by tacky 2 or 2.5G hardware and software licensing issues.</p>, <p>T-Mobile had to be aggressive in their bidding. Cingular, who has been rolling out it’s 3G network across the country in the last year, is poised to own the high-speed data market for mobiles. If T-Mobile really wants to be a player in this new-yet-profitable space, they had to move quickly, and move quickly they did.</p>, <p>With 120+ nationwide licenses, T-Mobile can now deploy true wireless broadband to most metro markets in the US, with short-term investments paying off. And they had better, as T-Mo has commited over $4 Billion to the FCC, as compared to Verizon’s $2.8 Billion, and $2.4 Billion from relative newcomers to the wireless world, a consortium of copper and fiber groups including Comcast and Time Warner.</p>, <p>This mad dash of bandwidth is remarkable in that it shows that wireless bandwidth is a true commodity. When something becomes commoditized, it truly becomes commonplace. With entertainment companies (including Satellite providers and Cable companies) bidding  this aggressively, it shows a maturity in the market that most people use to call Mom. There is irony there, you should share it.</p>, <p>The long and short is that T-Mobile is changing. With their recent handset offerings, this near-future upgrade in network capabilities makes them  a contender, or a force to be watched in the mobile field. If they can lay out this type of high-end product while keeping their level of customer service and palatable plans intact, they could easily shoot from number 4 to number 1 in the North American provider rankings. Translation: T-Mobile stalwarts, your day is coming.</p>, <p><a href="""" target=""_blank"">Auction 66: Advanced Wireless Services</a> [FCC]</p>]"
Magnatune's Answer to the Music Problem,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/><a href=""http://magnatune.com"">Magnatune</a>, founded by John Buckman in 2003, is a music label with an associated website. Today was the first time I heard about Magnatune (thanks to <a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/ajuneja/archive/2005/12/28/434094.aspx"">Ajay Juneja</a>), but I agree entirely with their business philosophy. I really think this is the music business model of the future.</p>, <p>There are two key business model issues to note that make Magnatune different.</p>, <p>The first is that Magnatude allows buyers to download music completely free of DRM and in the format (WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC and AAC) and quality of their choice (very similar to grey market <a href=""http://www.allofmp3.com"">allofmp3.com</a>, but in this case with the artist’s express permission). As I’ve <a href=""http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=103"">written before</a>, I think this is the only way a label or artist can charge for music – no DRM and offering a choice of formats and quality.</p>, <p>Albums sell for $5 and up (the buyer decides if he or she wants to pay more). Sales include downloadable cd art and inserts. CDs may also be purchased for delivery.</p>, <p>The second business model difference is how Magnatune <a href=""http://magnatune.com/info/terms"">treats its artists</a>. They share a flat 50% of gross proceeds (before any costs) from music sales with artists. They also share 50% of merchandise sales profits, although they have not started selling merchandise yet.</p>, <p>Magnatune doesn’t take on any artist that applies – only about 2.5% of those that apply are accepted according to an article by <a href=""http://stereophile.com/news/1205magnatune/"">Stereophile</a>.</p>, <p>Magnatune also gives the buyer the legal right to share the music with three other people, even allowing those people to download the music directly from Magnatune (a great viral marketing feature, by the way). Of course, without DRM, the music can be shared anyway, but giving people the right to do this is a nice touch.</p>, <p>And if you lose your music, you can re-download it from Magnatune at no additional cost (<a href=""http://www.scripting.com/2005/12/23.html#letMeExplainThisSlowly"">Dave Winer</a> will love this).</p>, <p>Yes, there are no high profile artists currently signed. But if Magnatune can get even a single big artist to move to them, they’ll be on the map permanently, and the artist will make a lot more money.</p>]"

Web 2.0 Companies I Couldn't Live Without,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">There have been numerous 2005 “best of” and 2006 “predictions” posts over the last few weeks as the year comes to an end. I’m not going to write one of those. Giving out “best of” awards seems presumptuous to me, given that I’ve been blogging all of six months. And while predictions are fun, they aren’t all that useful in the end.</p>, <p>What I do want to write about as I reminisce about the year ending in a couple of days are the Web 2.0 companies that I love and use every day.</p>, <p>I’ve tested over a thousand products this year, and have written about hundreds. And while some of the companies I write about get very positive reviews, I find that the only true test of the value of a product is its staying power: do I continue to use the product, and maybe even pay for it, as the days and months go by?</p>, <p>So for those of you that are curious, here is a short list of the companies that have held my attention, and that I would not choose to live without on the web:</p>, <p><strong><big><a href=""http://www.bloglines.com"">Bloglines</a></big></strong></p>, <p><img class=""shot2"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/12/bloglinessmall10.jpg"" style=""float:right;""/>I have a love/hate relationship with Bloglines, but they’ve recently <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/12/20/three-cheers-for-bloglines/"">improved performance</a> dramatically, and I really like that I can see the number of subscribers for each feed.

Seems simple, but no one does it now.</p>, <p>The aggregator will be in the “river of news” format, as opposed to folder based like Bloglines. The reason? Dave likes it that way.

Can social media help IT lock down the new Wild West of free range gunslingers, or is it too late to stop the virus of hierarchy flattening that the Net has spread?</p>, <p>If the campaign is moving toward a culture war as Obama continues to ride the financial crisis, then something similar may be about to occur in the corporate world. That’s why IT needs to look carefully at Sarah Palin’s strategy in the debate, where she simply dropped the pretense of playing ball and told Biden, the media, and most directly the 50 million viewers that she wasn’t going to worry about the format or the rules or what the event sought to project as its rationale, but rather talk directly without filtering to her audience.</p>, <p>It was an effective moment, particularly for an electorate starved for straight talk, and also for a candidate who had been having near-fatal problems with answering questions. But what it mirrors with the dialogue with IT is that she was saying what social media users are saying, namely, we’re gonna use this stuff no matter what you think about it. Palin, who up until that moment had largely succeeded by exceeding dismal expectations, suddenly connected with us no matter whether we think her woefully unprepared for the job or that she brings fresh blood to the process of transforming government.</p>, <p>Similarly, social media-enabled applications and frameworks immediately transform algorithmic text analysis by adding the weight of personal and/or affiliate reputation to the content being routed. This so-called “people” context makes possible much quicker decisions based on more efficient arbitrage of information. In a jury room, the power brokers quickly identify the several key players on both sides of the question, then make sure to give them enough screentime to represent their constituencies, then force a vote. The foreman is usually not the dominant player but rather a floor manager, given the signal when the votes are apparent for a decision.</p>, <p>This social graph mining can be extended via instant messaging without fear of interception over email, which provides an audit trail that implies consequences for either spreading information beyond a need to know basis or not keeping superiors or lateral peers appropriately in the loop. IM is perceived as “dangerous” from IT’s perspective, but strategic from a getting it done view often held by CEOs and consultants who encourage collaborative behavior.</p>, <p>Social media surfaces this conflict and creates the notion of a hybrid – quasi-public IM and activity streaming – that endows a class of messages with implicit power that neither email nor IM nor blogging alone have. By enabling realtime messages that can instantly convert to direct conversations with unanticipated endpoints, micromessages create a business value proposition that transcends the mandated reporting culture of SarbOx as well as endemic information hoarding.</p>, <p>Real work gets done in these conversations, and typically this work is being performed in the “open” because the participants realize (and have been given “permission” to work at this live level) that they have little to fear from competition because their access to participation trumps others who by definition have to react after the fact. Not only has the value moved on to the next set of conversations, but the product of this work is now being marketed to the audience most likely to buy it.</p>, <p>Remember that social graph data encapsulates affinity behavior, which is more likely to yield targets for accelerated business and idea transformation. Those still hanging back while waiting for trends to emerge are caught in a backwater, while the trends are busy being generated and validated by fast-moving microcommunities. So whatever you think of Palin, don’t confuse the power of the idea with the tactical messenger who brought it to the party. IT is ultimately there to serve the most efficient business process mandated by the company’s reason for existence. Palin showed executive competence, and a great deal more, whoever actually wrote the lines.</p>]"

Selling the Downturn: Schwartz and the Silver Lining,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">As the slowdown begins to tickle the Internet economy, voices from unlikely places are grappling with the “opportunity” the possible worldwide depression presents for the tech industry. Steve Ballmer is on a barnstorming tour about Microsoft’s move into what he temporarily calls the Windows Cloud OS&gt; IBM is busy opening 13 cloud computing centers around the world. And Jonathan Schwartz has slathered lipstick all over what purports to be an internal memo that he then decided to release as a <a href=""http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/innovation_loves_a_crisis"">blog post</a>. My guess, jaundiced as it may be in the wake of a month of Palin/McCain bottom-is-up sideways speak, is that the memo was always designed primarily for the public.</p>, <p>Innovation loves a crisis, says Jonathan, and he suggests how open source took advantage of the Tech Bubble Bust to insert itself into challenged proprietary niches. After running through Sun’s current position in database (MySQL), storage (ZFS with OpenStorage) OS (OpenSolaris), virtualization (xVM), and so on, he drives it home with this odd construction:</p>, <p>Imagine if our portfolio had been this strong when the dot com bubble burst – we’d have swept the floor, and been in a dramatically different spot. </p>, <p>So what is Jonathan saying – that the last time they were in this boat, they blew it, and that’s why they are going to nail it this time? No, that wouldn’t be the message he’s trying to send to his troops. Instead, he might be saying that the price pressure of an open source strategy will drive customers in, cement ongoing relationships, and upsell the new combined base to the synergies of Sun’s virtualization platform across OS, storage, identity services, and OS.</p>, <p>There’s more than a little McMessaging here: We missed it last time, but now we’re positioned to clean up the mess. But what about Microsoft’s freeware rumblings in the virtualization arena, or Cisco’s plans to bake similar value into the routers that form the foundational layer of network services. Schwartz emerged from Sun’s revenue collapse after the Internet bubble with a series of ahead-of-the-curve strategies that correctly predicted and modeled Google’s leveraging of open source dynamics. But Microsoft and others may be cashing in on Jonathan’s insight.</p>, <p>The question now becomes: What insight does Schwartz bring now to the conversation with customers. If they are, as he writes, under stress, and therefore “open to change”, what combination of leading edge hardware and system integration of virtualization will produce immediate results in a climate where Sun’s focus on financial services is likely to be challenged by a wave of mergers, buyouts, and outright collapses. Schwartz and Sun have blazed a trail to the cloud computing enterprise, but now they have to defend themselves against having done perhaps too good a job of turning the market toward the new reality.</p>, <p>We don’t get the benefit of internal responses to Jonathan’s memo, but comments on the blog post suggest <a href=""http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/innovation_loves_a_crisis#comment-1223059935000"">concern</a> that Sun sales is not necessarily aligned with Jonathan’s goals.</p>, <p>You might want to check that your sales force is actually pushing the new Sun technology, as opposed to pushing super-expensive legacy technology. For sure, I know of current cases where Sun sales people are pushing expensive disk arrays rather than ZFS on cheap disk; and VMWare (which costs more than the server itself) rather than xVM; and… well you get the picture.</p>, <p>Jonathan makes a good case when he says, “Now’s the time our customers will be most open to change.” But he faces a tougher sell inside Sun, similar to the ones he’s slogged through with his open sourcing of Solaris and Java. Perhaps the sound of approaching competitors singing the same song will light the fire under his troops.</p>]"

Seven Key Requirements Corporate IT Needs from PaaS,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><em>This guest post was contributed by <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/pankaj-malviya"">Pankaj Malviya</a>, a serial entrepreneur with more than 15 years experience in enterprise software product design, development, and implementation of customer service solutions for Fortune 500 companies. In 2006, Pankaj founded <a href=""http://www.longjump.com/"">LongJump</a>, a Platform-as-a-Service provider that helps companies rapidly develop and deliver customized applications online (see our coverage of LongJump <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/company-index/?company=longjump"">here</a>).</em></p>, <p>It’s time for corporate IT to get their heads in the clouds.</p>, <p>Cloud computing initiatives are gaining momentum with businesses of all sizes, particularly with enterprises that are looking to adopt the right solutions to address their ongoing business and IT challenges. Emerging on the horizon is a broad range of Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings that enterprise business and IT units are examining more thoroughly.  PaaS solutions are appealing as a direct evolution of SaaS-based, single-discipline solutions that are targeted toward the horizontal enterprise.</p>, <p>Why should corporate IT departments rely on the costly, time-intensive maintenance of heavy infrastructure and continually reinvent the wheel to create powerful applications?  PaaS offers a simple promise: develop, deploy and fine-tune enterprise-class SaaS applications within a single environment across all business units. The net effect is a more cost-effective, centralized way to extend, build and manage custom applications.</p>, <p>Thus IT is free to focus on innovating solutions that engage knowledge workers in increased productivity and collaboration and improve overall business efficiency.  PaaS also affects the economics of application development, providing a faster time-to-value for developing, deploying and integrating custom applications, resulting in a more than 50 % improvement on productivity for total platform spend per dollar, according to McKinsey &amp; Co.</p>, <p>As such, corporate IT has an important leadership role in applying PaaS. Unlike single-department SaaS tools where a business unit may have had primary say for functionality, adoption and manageability, PaaS has a cross-departmental impact within an organization. It’s critical for corporate IT, and not just the business units themselves, to fully understand these different platforms and provide the governance and manageability needed to sustain their value. Otherwise, it can become yet another rogue technology that IT will have to deal with, rather than the leveraged solution it promises to be.</p>, <p>Current PaaS providers offer many components resulting in widely different PaaS offerings that can be broken down into three buckets:</p>, <p>What should corporate IT require in their PaaS solution?  From LongJump’s customers, certain requirements keep coming up as key to their adoption and success. We’ve identified 7 requirements that all IT organizations should consider.</p>, <p>It’s hard to miss the growing buzz around PaaS and Cloud Computing. Gartner named cloud computing one of the top ten strategic technologies for 2008, noting that web platforms are emerging to provide service-based access to infrastructure services, information, applications, and business processes through cloud computing environments.</p>, <p>There is a real promise for enterprise organizations to benefit from PaaS, but it’s important that IT fully take control and advantage to meet their application needs. Platforms that meet the needs and conditions faced within enterprise IT will have a real impact on an organization’s ability to streamline their application projects.</p>]"

Back at the end of July, Microsoftee Dare Obasanjo attacked the Open Web Foundation for being a bunch of kids fresh out of college who hadn’t heard of IETF or other standards bodies. I dashed off a post calling on Dare to revert to his previously ecumenical ways of supporting bottom-up standards development, and to stop his partisan attacks on these Animal House attempts and their predatory sponsors from Google et al. The response in comments took me to task for being an idiot but others were not so sure.</p>, <p>Flash forward to a few days ago, when another post by Obasanjo popped up as a pingback linked to the phrase “<a href=""http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/10/05/ThePortableContactsAPIKillingThePasswordAntiPatternOnceAndForAll.aspx#"">personal attacks by Techcrunch</a>” with more of the same, this time focusing on the Portable Contacts API promulgated by OWF co-conspirator Chris Messina and Plaxo’s Joseph Smarr. The money graf:</p>, <p>If anything, I’m concerned by the growing number of interdependent specs that seem poised to have a significant impact on the Web and yet are being defined outside of formal standards bodies in closed processes funded by big companies. For example, about half of the references in the Portable Contacts API specs are to IETF RFCs while the other half are to specs primarily authored by Google and Yahoo! employees outside of any standards body (OpenSocial, OAuth, OpenSearch, XRDS-Simple, etc). I’ve previously questioned the rise of semi-closed, vendor driven consortiums in the area of Web specifications given that we have perfectly good and open standards bodies like IETF for defining the Open Web but this led to <a href=""http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/07/31/some-thoughts-on-standards-and-dare-obasanjo/"">personal attacks on TechCrunch</a> with no real reasons given for why Web standards need to go in this direction. I find that worrying.</p>, <p>I called Messina up and arranged for he and I to have a conversation today on The Gillmor Gang, where we touched on the history and attitudes of Obasanjo in the context of what clearly is something too tempting to be left alone. Messina goes into some depth about the rationale for OWF and its genesis, mostly as the outgrowth of what Chris calls work done to solve small problems. OWF, as Messina suggests, is an attempt to help leverage legal issues common to many of the “specs authored by Google and Yahoo! employees outside of any standards body” to help move these useful tools from point solution to specs able to be bought into by big companies or even the aforementioned IETF.</p>, <p>I’ll let Chris <a href=""http://gillmorgang.beta.techcrunch.com/2008/10/06/the-gillmor-gang/"">explain</a> the details of Portable Contacts and much more, but, though I tried to broker some conversation directly between Obasanjo and the college kids to bridge the gap between them, here I’ll just parse that first sentence of Dare’s:</p>]"

Dell’s also said they’re planning on upgrading the Inspiron and Latitude models sometime soon, and we’ll post an update comparing how these Dell Core 2 Duo processors perform to the Core Duo ones previously in these models.

EchoSign Solves Signature Page Woes,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>I just spent some time looking at <a href=""http://www.echosign.com"">EchoSign</a>, a new service launched by Jason Lemkin and Jeff Zwelling.</p>, <p>EchoSign helps you keep executed documents organized. Document writing and negotiation has been largely handled online, via emails, for the last ten years (before that, fedex and faxing of versions back and forth was the way to go). However, when it comes time to execute a final agreement, both sides generally print the document and fax it back to the other side. Unless someone scans the signature pages and creates a pdf, there is no electronic signed copy.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Efax helps somewhat and I often ask people to send docs to my efax number so that I have an electronic copy. But Echosign, besides being free, goes further. Once a document is finalized, you simply upload it to the site and use their interface to email it out to everyone. The emailed document includes a fax cover sheet with the fax number pre-filled. The other side simply prints it, signs it, and sends it to the fax number on the pre-printed form. The original party then receives a pdf version of the signed document for filing, printing and/or forwarding.</p>, <p>I have no idea what the business model is, since its a free service, but EchoSign definitely fixes a big problem for lawyers and companies trying to keep executed agreements and other documents organized.</p>, <p>I’ve looked at other services that are trying to solve the version control of documents…hosting a word or other document that the parties can change and finalize is a great idea and something law firms would easily pay for. <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/12/10/writely-is-kicking-a/"">Writely</a> and the other ajax office application companies would tweak their services to accomplish this of course.

To run “Hello World” all you have to do is follow two simple steps:</p>, <p>
1. Unpack the ZIP file to your PSP’s PHOTO folder<br/>
2. Navigate to your PSP’s PHOTO director and attempt to view the newly transferred picture</p>, <p>Note: You may find that the screen does not show correct (occasionally happens) – just restart your PSP (fully shutoff by holding the power button up) and open the picture again.

"AllPeers Is The FireFox ""Killer App""","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>I’ve had a chance to talk to <a href=""http://www.allpeers.com"">AllPeers</a> founders Cedric Maloux and Matthew Gertner. This company is set to take the world by storm. In my opinon this single firefox extension will massively increase the attractiveness of that already popular browser, drawing more millions away from embattled Internet Explorer.</p>, <p>AllPeers is a simple, persistent buddy list in the browser. Initially, interaction with those buddies will be limited to discovering and sharing files – If you choose to, you can share any file on your network with one or more of your friends. They will be able to see what files you choose to share (even getting an RSS feed of new files you include), and with a single click download it to their own hard drive.</p>, <p>AllPeers will work even when the sharer is offline – AllPeers is a bittorent client, and will allow files to be pulled from multiple sources. When downloading, the file may be grabbed partially or fully from others you have shared it with (or who shared it with you). So a user just clicks on a file, and waits for it to eventually download. <a href=""http://www.allpeers.com/blog/2005/12/22/allpeers-screenshots/"">Screen shots can be viewed here</a>.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/allpeers.jpg""/></p>, <p>With AllPeers, I can share photos and home movies with my parents, songs (and anything else) with friends, and also access the files that they choose to share.</p>, <p>In the future, AllPeers will also have folders to allow public sharing (probably with restrictions to control copyright violations). I also assume they will build chat and VOIP functionality into the application as well.</p>, <p>AllPeers will not be advertising funded. There are hints that the business model may eventually be centered on monetization of paid content, but that will be down the road. For now, they are focused on launching with the basic shared-folder approach. And that is fine with me – I’ll be hooked from the second I can get my hands on it.</p>, <p>AllPeers has seven employees, is based in Prague and is a UK company. They are self and angel funded to date. If you’d like to sign up for the beta, <a href=""http://www.allpeers.com/more_f.htm"">enter your email here</a>.

HTC is the shadowy man-behind-the-curtain for Cingular’s self-branded smartphones, and T-Mobile’s MDA and SDA.

It will also include GPRS/EDGE, and WiFi, but no support for a true 3G network. Like the Q, the device runs Windows Mobile 5: Smartphone Edition and has a decent-looking QWERTY keyboard, but no touchscreen.

This is because under French law handset and service contracts cannot be sold as one package. Hence Apple wants more revenues from the tariff. The article adds that if an agreement is not reached by the middle of next week, Orange will miss its Christmas sales window.</p>, <p>The legal separation of handset and service contracts is a situation which exists in several other European countries, meaning Apple may find rolling out the iPhone in a similar manner across Europe increasingly difficult.

The “Lennon” (likely to be named the 750w) we know will include WiFi, but it’s unknown if this device will include UMTS and class 10 EDGE.

The usual suite of Windows Mobile apps will be included, including Office document reading and writing. In addition, look for pTunes, the excellent Mp3/WMA/internet radio app, and MobiTV. For the latter a seperate subscription will be likely, but the carriers may find a way to subsidize this.

Continuous Partial Innovation,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">This week’s activity in the tech sector seems guided by the rest of the economy, as the world holds its collective breath while waiting for the other, or any, shoe to drop. The presidential race seems to have stabilized with a significant if not conclusive lead for Obama. Apple announced refreshes of its laptop line, Microsoft sold off its Silverlight 2.0 news in advance of the PDC, and pictures and videos of the Gphone surfaced.</p>, <p>The Silverlight press conference produced a few interesting factoids, including the news that Silverlight penetration has reached 1 in 4 households after the launch at the Olympics and subsequent coverage of the Democratic National Convention. I asked Scott Guthrie how Chrome, Android, and iPhone support was coming, and got back: progress, optimism, and fuggetaboutit. Some subtle hints about data caching capabilities, forthcoming  application announcements, and Silverlight code serving dual purpose within both browser and desktop code suggest Guthrie’s role within the company is continuing to expand.</p>, <p>Apple’s conservative approach to the so-called Netbook segment comes as no surprise. Each new announcement seems to roll up the last’s technological progress, which today centered on the MacBook Air’s build process being ported up and down the MacBook line. More forward-looking was the continued integration of Tim Cook and other executives into the presentation, with Cook in an increasingly active posture including some of the Jobsian humor long reserved for the boss. The net effect was of orderly consolidation of Apple’s transformation into the dominant architecture of the mobile Net.</p>, <p>The thread that ties so much of what’s visible of the tech iceberg together is the success, or difficulty, of managing the flow from old to new guard in the Cloud era. Age is really not a factor, as Jobs is signaling by changing Apple’s rhythm from Big Bang to continuous partial innovation. Microsoft is struggling not with the technology so much as the challenges of messaging, essaying the transition from structured to unstructured media so personified by the Twitter phenomenon.</p>, <p>And then there’s Sun’s Jonathan Schwartz, who broke a several-year moratorium on conversations with me with an intriguing new open source announcement. Whatever you think of the business model, certainly Schwartz continues to be a trailblazer in the leveraging of social media fundamentals.</p>, <p><span class=""embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video"" style=""text-align:center; display: block;""><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" class=""youtube-player"" height=""360"" sandbox=""allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/5r3JSciJf5M?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent"" style=""border:0;"" width=""640""></iframe></span></p>]"

Is Fav.or.it a Digg killer?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://fav.or.it"">Fav.or.it</a> is tiny start-up based in a small office an hour’s drive from London. But this “feature rich community-based feed reading system” is about to unleash a wholly original take on reading blogs and news feeds which could see it face-down even the social bookmarking giants like <a href=""http://Digg.com"">Digg</a> and the newer kids like <a href=""http://CoComment.com"">CoComment</a>.</p>, <p>Favorit brings together blog reading and replying into one simple web application. Its innovative web interface is designed to allow users to let users read any kind of RSS feed, cut-up, mashed-up with other feeds or “sliced” in any kind of way.</p>, <p><img alt=""homepage"" src=""http://uk.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/homepage.gif""/></p>, <p>It’s also is a classic Web 2.0 startup which will attempt to solve one of the web’s most frustrating issues, i.e. the separation of reading RSS feeds from being able to comment on the post. Admittedly any blog post is only a click away from a user being able to comment on it. But imagine being to comment, Twitter-like, under a feed and not even have to care about filling in your name, email, etc. Just comment, save and carry on reading. Having witnessed it myself at an exclusive demo, I can confirm that this is what Favorit is capable of.</p>, <p>Favorit will this week launch a private beta based on a submitted database of 10,000 blog feeds. (The site is exhibiting in London at <a href=""http://www.futureofwebapps.com/"">FOWA</a> this week and at <a href=""http://mashupdemo.com"">mashup demo</a>.</p>, <p>What’s the Backstory? Favorit is owned by <a href=""http://www.assembleron.com/"">Assembleron Limited</a>, a one-man startup based in in the grounds of Reading University, UK. Founder Nick Halstead (and managing director) came from the games world, having worked at BSkyB interactive games, Empire and Argonaut prior to that. But over the last two years he has immersed himself in the world of blogs and Web 2.0 trends. For the last five months Halstead, working with a couple of freelancers, has been developing the Favorit core engine.</p>, <p>Although Favorit is being bootstrapped right now, Halstead is in conversation with a number of potential backers. To see why, read on.</p>, <p><strong>Turning feeds into slices</strong></p>, <p>Favorit approaches the issue of reading RSS feeds with the concept of ‘slices’. Each post in a feed is categorised and tagged. By choosing a category, tag or rank (or a combination of each) the user can filter what they are reading in a more efficient manner than the normal ‘hose’ effect of having to laboriously wade through hundreds of blog posts in hundreds of feeds. Favorit has dubbed every combination of tag, rank or category a ‘slice’.</p>, <p>Slices can be created from tags, categories, rank (0-5 stars), a person (all that persons feeds, or their posts, or a mashup of more than one person), one or more feeds and finally date (range, single dates, /when/yesterday).</p>, <p>If a post does not include any meta data for tagging Favorit automatically generates tags using its own home-grown system. It will also allow the community to edit tags based upon a simple voting system that would allow tags to be added or removed. When you read a feed or a slice on Favorit it will automatically generate a tag cloud based on that content. Pick one post and it lists the tags. Pick 5 feeds to read all in one slice and it adjusts the cloud again.</p>, <p>So for example, if you only want to read about the iPhone in one feed, you create an iPhone slice for that feed or tag. You can also combine several feeds, so “Scoble”, “MacWorld” and “Google News”, and create an intelligent ‘slice’ of all three which only picks out the word iPhone.</p>, <p>Now I know you are going to say you can do something vaguely similar with smart lists inside an RSS reader. But to do this requires a lot of copying and pasting of feeds and searches. On Favorit it’s just about clicking the feeds from which you want to create a slice. Anyone who uses Favorit will have an OPML file which they can also export.</p>, <p>Any slice can be shared and on top of that the slice can be instantly turned into a feed in its own right. Thus Favorit is going up against the business models of feed aggregators like FeedDigest.</p>, <p><strong>Comment posting with an API<br/>
</strong><br/>
Currently, sites like Digg try to draw the conversation on blogs towards its own site. And they’ve done it very well. But surely blogs would be better off having those Digg comments appear on their own sites?</p>, <p>The problem right now is that not all the blogging platforms have open access to their commenting systems.  Plus, RSS feeds for entries are generally separated from feeds for comments.</p>, <p>Based on PHP and the Zend Framework, Favorit will launch an API during the public beta enabling it to hook into many more blogging platforms to allow it to send comments back to the sites. Halstead hopes the API will create an ecosystem outside of Favorit.</p>, <p><img alt=""reply"" src=""http://uk.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/reply.gif""/></p>, <p>Now of course there is a glaring issue here. Sites thrive on traffic. Take away the need for a user to go to a site and comment and you potentially rob the site of a great deal of traffic. What’s the answer?</p>, <p>Well, by removing barriers to commenting, Favorit potentially creates a faster turnaround of comments to blogs. Halstead, admits that aggregating comments may remove some traffic, but it could also build extra readership and feed subscription. The short answer is we won’t know until Favorit has been operating for a few weeks.</p>, <p>But it’s fair to say that Favorit will probably be of most benefit to ‘long tail’ bloggers currently sitting in the echo chamber.</p>, <p>Think about it. If your blog can be indexed and appear in a river of news alongside some of the biggest blogs, with commenting made a great deal easier, a smaller blog could easily be dragged further up the tail. On Favorit, every blog has a chance to be read by every user, and although users have the option to filter out lower ranking blogs, the system could encourage users to find new blogs outside of the top 1000. Unread feeds won’t be moved into the main database until people start adding them.</p>, <p>It must be noted that Favorit can only put comments on a blog with its permission. A blogger either creates an account on Favorit and supplies it with account details (via XMLRPC) or the blogger installs Favorit’s widget. The full list of supported blog platforms will appear in the next few weeks, although I can safely say that Blogger and any WordPress.com or hosted WordPress site will be included, though Typepad or LiveJournal just yet. They are aiming to support 80-90% of blogs out there.</p>, <p>Favorit will also pick up trackbacks and coments that appear on a post.</p>, <p>CoComment take note: Favorit also tracks any comments that you would happen to write directly onto other blogs, so long as it’s in the database.</p>, <p><strong>What about comment spam?<br/>
</strong><br/>
Since the site won’t allow the posting of comments without a user being signed in, spammers will be severely restricted, unless they plan to hire hundreds of people to manually spam (which is unlikely given the economics). Favorit will also internally police the system and allow the community to report spamming from signed-up users.</p>, <p>But could Favorit pick up spam from external sites it trawls? Possibly, says Halstead. That is a possibility for which they will have to rely on their own anti-spam systems and the community to police.</p>, <p><strong>Competitors?<br/>
</strong><br/>
It’s easier to figure put who Favorit is not competing against. In its sites are, for example, are elements of Blogger, Digg, Buzztracker, to name just three. Then there is <a href=""http://co.mments.com/"">Co.mments</a> and <a href=""http://commentful.com/"">Commentful</a>.</p>, <p>And the recently launched <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2007/08/07/intense-debate-soups-up-your-blog-comments/"">Intense Debate</a> is a souped-up blog commenting system that adds a lot of features for publishers and commenters alike, but unlike Favorit it requires a plug-in to be installed.</p>, <p><strong>Affect on advertising?<br/>
</strong><br/>
This a glaring issue with Favorit. If everyone who currently reads commercial blogs (like TechCrunch) switches from the original web ages to the feeds forever, no-one would see the advertising. The answer of course is that advertising, to be effective, would need to switch to RSS feeds. This is possible since Favorit does not touch the content of the feed. But it is also controversial. Many publishers still only provide partial feeds, and many blogs hate putting ads in their feeds.</p>, <p>It’s a tricky topic. “I suspect partial feeds just won’t be read as much,” says Halstead. And therein lies the rub.</p>, <p><strong>Tracking attention beats voting<br/>
</strong><br/>
Because Favorit uses Javascript it will gauge <strong><em>how long you read a post</em></strong> and what you did before during and after. This data is invaluable both for advertising targeting and for data mining, and its far more sutble than Digg’s voing system. Eventually the site hopes to rank as many as a million blogs in order of attention.</p>, <p><strong><em>Because it will track what people actually read, Favorit will be a far more accurate reflection of what is popular online than Digg, which everyone knows is increasingly subject to gaming. </em></strong></p>, <p>Although Halstead went to great lengths with me to emphasise that Favorit is a different animal than Digg, there is no getting away from the comparison. And it’s quite clear that capturing attention meta-data beats ‘voting’ hands down.</p>, <p>He does admit, however, that “We’ll have so much data it’s about working out what to do. We’ll be in the same category as as Facebook in terms of amount of data.”</p>, <p><strong>A blogging platform as well?!<br/>
</strong><br/>
Favorit is not just going to be a feed reader. It is also a blogging platform. By creating a subdomain, such as ‘gadgets.fav.or.it’ users will be able to write their own posts into the system. Using this, they can pull in their feed from their blog as well as post directly into Favorit. Any comments on the Favorit subdomain blog then appear back at the original blog.</p>, <p><img alt=""tc"" src=""http://uk.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/techcrunch.gif""/></p>, <p>Since it’s all widget based, users will be able to ‘pimp’ their Favorit blogs with a set of widgets – many form outside suppliers – which Favorit will build into the system. But you won’t be able to access the underlying HTML or CSS.</p>, <p>Here’s where the revenue comes in. Favorit plans to share advertising revenues with users who create these subdomain blogs.</p>, <p>Of course, it goes without saying that allowing users to create subdomains could open a can of worms. Favorit plans to police the creation of the sites. and will limit the number of sub-domain names one profile user can register. So to create a lot you’d have to create more than one profile by hand. But we’ll see how they manage that in due course. It could get interesting.</p>, <p><strong>The ‘Long Tail of Techmemes’<br/>
</strong><br/>
And of course, this is worth money. If the Nike subdomain pulls in everything there is to know about Nike, Google could be among those knocking on the door.</p>, <p>And consider this. Favorit could also enable a ‘long-tail of Techmemes’. In theory anyone could create a sub-domain site which, say, tracks blog posts about football, or golf, or race horse breeding. You name it.</p>, <p><strong>The future<br/>
</strong><br/>
Halstead is aiming to get 50,000 users inside the next 3 months. “We’re not aiming for Twitter growth” he tells me.</p>, <p>But with its geek-friendly layout and jargon, Favorit is not going to be viewed as a mass-mark consumer-friendly site any time, soon. But given that it will be indexing tens of thousands of blogs, being able to slice and dice what you read but rarely seeing the letters XML or RSS, it does have the potential to open up feed-reading to a wider audience than perhaps other aggregators have done so far.</p>, <p>At the end of the day, by uniting feeds with comments Favorit has an opportunity to put itself at the centre of the blogosphere. And that’s a good place to be. To re-work a well-worn phrase, if markets are conversations, then Favorit is money.</p>, <p>[<a href=""http://digg.com/tech_news/Is_Favorit_a_Digg_killer"">Digg this story – ironically</a>]</p>]"

Toshiba to Push Blog Reviews to Mobile Shoppers,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>There is a<a href=""http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200601070120.html""> report</a> that Toshiba is developing software that will allow people to take a picture of the bar code label of many products, send it to a related service and quickly receive back information related to the product.</p>, <p>The data the service returns? From blogs. Yep, Toshiba will send back summary information on how many blogs gave the product positive and negative reviews. Related product information will also be displayed.</p>, <p>There is no information now about how Toshiba will go about gathering and analyzing blog data, and whether the data will need to be in a structured format or not.

Don't Blow Your Beta,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">I’ve seen hundreds of new products launch over the last six months, and I think I have some pretty good advice for companies that want to improve their beta release.</p>, <p>In addition to my personal experiences with companies, I recently wrote “<a href=""http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=101"">What Annoys You Most About Betas?</a>” on Crunchnotes to help me prepare for this post. The comments to that post give a lot of direct feedback from early adopters and much of that information is reflected here as well.</p>, <p>Every company does things a little differently. Some rush the product out, features-be-damned. Others wait, and wait, and wait, until its “perfect”. Some companies are secretive. Others open. And so on.</p>, <p>Certainly there is no set recipe for success (or failure). But there are a number of easy-to-avoid traps when building and presenting a product. Likewise, there are a number of “crowd pleaser” features that always get positive comments.</p>, <p><big><strong>First Impressions</strong></big></p>, <p>The main thing to remember is that you generally only get one look from the early adopter crowd. There is just too much going on for them to give a flawed company multiple chances to get it right. You either grab their attention, or you lose their attention. If you grab ’em, everything is easier from then on. If you bore them, you are facing an incredible uphill battle just to get them back to the site. So, basically, don’t blow your first impression.</p>, <p>Once they’ve made the decision that you are not noteworthy, it is very hard to get them to pay attention again.</p>, <p><big><strong>Rolling Feature Release</strong></big></p>, <p>Somewhere along the line people got the idea that rolling out functionality in stages is a good thing. There are two arguments for this.</p>, <p>First, it allows an earlier launch. Ok. That’s true.</p>, <p>The second argument is that by releasing features in stages, you’ll have regular news that bloggers and other journalists can talk about. This is also true, but a lot of companies get a little too religious about this and start to pull features just so that they will have news down the road. I hear this all the time from companies – “please don’t write about this feature yet. we want to release it next month and get you to write about us again then.”</p>, <p>If your first impression is positive, people will want to hear about future news. If it isn’t, people won’t care. Focus on making that launch a memorable one.</p>, <p>Every new feature is not news.</p>, <p><big><strong>Incomplete Features</strong></big></p>, <p>Some people take the “rolling feature release” idea above to mean they can release half-baked stuff. This allows for a quicker launch, of course. Slap a label on it, like “developer release”, “alpha” or “beta” and the hope is that people will be understanding and kind, and give you good advice and suggestions for improvement and evolution.</p>, <p>This is a bad idea. <u>You will be crucified</u> for wasting people’s time and they will leave brutal comments slamming your product. It is far better to delay launch, or remove the feature entirely, than show stuff that doesn’t work.</p>, <p>This is a “fall on your sword” issue. If the team is pressing to do this, spend political capital in fighting it. Your equity will be worth more because of it.</p>, <p>Pre-launch labels do not protect you from scorn.</p>, <p><big><strong>The Browser Issue</strong></big></p>, <p>Internet Explorer has dominant market share, and (at least today) you must work on IE to get mass consumer adoption.</p>, <p>However, most of the early adopters use Firefox, and a lot of them use Macs. At one point, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/09/26/70-of-techcrunch-readers-use-firefox/"">80% of TechCrunch readers used the Firefox or Safari browsers</a>.</p>, <p>If you don’t support Firefox and, to a lesser extent, Safari, when you launch, you are going to be shunned by the early adopters.</p>, <p><big><strong>Landing Pages</strong></big></p>, <p>Many companies put up a basic landing page while they are in development. These landing pages usually ask for people’s email address, promising notification when the product launches.</p>, <p>I personally like landing pages because it gives me something to point to when writing about a pre-release product. But many users don’t like them. A common complaint from people is that they sign up on a landing page and don’t hear anything for months (so they forget all about it). Another complaint is that the landing page doesn’t give clear information on what the product will do.</p>, <p>If you are going to do it, make sure that launch is imminent and that you give fairly detailed information on the product vision.</p>, <p><big><strong>Bloggers and Blogging</strong></big></p>, <p>Most early adopters read blogs. A lot of them write blogs, too. Engage with bloggers.</p>, <p>They are a powerful way to spread your vision, and they are generally much more technically adept than the average big publication journalist. They don’t have to deal with editors and fact checkers (for better or worse), and so it is often easier to get your pure vision out there for the world to read.</p>, <p>You should also publish a blog. Not only is it the best way to tell the world about what you are doing, it also gives you the opportunity to <a href=""http://www.nik.com.au/archives/2005/12/30/on-being-techcrunched/"">repay bloggers</a> who write about you with a link back to them. Don’t underestimate the importance to a blogger of being linked to on your blog. Just like you, bloggers want mind share.</p>, <p>Never, never, never attack your critics on your blog or in comments on other blogs. Engage with them and be constructive even if they are not. Even if they are dead wrong, thousands of other people probably have had the same thought and haven’t bothered to write about it. Don’t assume they are a jerk; rather, assume that your communications are flawed and need to be re-thought. You are going to have to develop a very thick skin.</p>, <p><big><strong>Obvious Trust Issues</strong></big></p>, <p>Don’t ask for more personal information from your users than you absolutely need. Yes, having good demographic information on your users, like zip code and birth date, is a valuable asset. But many people won’t sign up for services that are asking for more information than absolutely necessary, or will purposefully enter false information.</p>, <p>Don’t break people’s trust during the registration process. Be like <a href=""http://www.netvibes.com"">Netvibes</a> if you can and offer a near-complete service without registration at all.</p>, <p><big><strong>Summary</strong></big></p>, <p>My guess is that there will be even more useful suggestions given directly by users in the comments to this post. These comments are even more important than what I write, so you should listen carefully to this feedback.</p>, <p>There are a number of recent posts by others that will be at least indirectly useful to companies launching betas as well.

This, our final contest for August, involves creating chains of users. Up for grabs is an Motorola Q and a Kodak Easyshare V603. Here’s how to play…</p>, <p>We need you to tell one friend to take a picture of themself holding up your name on a sheet of paper. That person will then tell one other person to take a picture of themselves holding up your name and so on and so on. The entrant with the longest chain will win the Q and the entrant with the coolest pictures will win the Kodak. By cool we mean maybe a celebrity in the mix or maybe some women so I don’t have to fish through 500 pictures of guys throwing the shocker from their cubicles.</p>, <p>Example: Joe Smith tells Jane Doe to take her picture. She holds up a sign that says Joe Smith. Then Jane Doe tells Sally Wilson to take a picture of herself holding up Joe Smith’s name and so on. Put James Woods or Mischa Barton in there and you win the Kodak. I’m serious.</p>, <p>Put those pictures in a big fat email and send it to crunchgear at gmail dot com with the subject “6 Degrees.” The deadline is next Thursday, August 31 at Noon PST. These are two great prizes and the entries have been pretty sparse, so with a little effort you can probably get your hands on some major tech gear.</p>, <p>Put those pictures in a big fat email and send it to crunchgear at gmail dot com with the subject “6 Degrees.” The deadline is next Thursday, August 31 at Noon PST.

AOL Acquires Truveo,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>AOL <a href=""http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/060110/20060110005528.html?.v=1"">announced</a> the acquisition of media search engine <a href=""http://www.truveo.com"">Truveo</a> today.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed publicly, but this was not a small deal.</p>, <p>Truveo has an innovative way for quickly indexing media content such as audio and video, and figuring out what it is even if there is little or no meta data associated with it. It is an incredibly useful technology and search engine.</p>, <p>I like Truveo, which launched in September, because it relies on a core hard-to-duplicate technology rather than a  business plan which creates a network effect. The only other web 2.0 company that I can think of off the top of my head that is similar is Riya, which is also building some very tricky stuff. This doesn’t mean I don’t like network-effect companies. To the contrary, I love them. But if you can build something that is protectable on the IP side as well, then you may just have a large liquidity event, too.</p>, <p>Jeff Clavier is an advisory to Truveo and <a href=""http://blog.softtechvc.com/2006/01/search_consolid.html"">wrote about the acquitision today</a> as well. I’ve gotten to know Jeff quite a bit over the last few months.

More Edge Reviews – iNods,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>The rise of edge content continues – <a href=""http://inods.com"">iNods</a>, which launched today, is the most recent example.</p>, <p>iNods aggregates blog and other edge review content and displays it in a centralized way for users. Unlike similar services <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/12/18/edge-of-network-reviews-kritx/"">kritX</a> and <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/blogcritics"">blogcritics</a>, which aggregate general review information contained on blogs (and are excellent), iNods is completely focused on shopping.</p>, <p>Like the others, iNods has realized that there is a massive amount of review information out there in the blogosphere. And more is being created every day. They are harvesting that information, making it searchable, and driving highly targeted traffic right back to the blogs to read that content.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>They also require blog registration to include content, although they do already have fairly deep content and so I assume they have added some sources without their registration. They say that they will support microformats in the future, but at this point it is not a requirement. This means bloggers do not need to format their data in any particular way to have it included on iNods.</p>, <p>I’d like to see these services expand their technology so as not to require blogger registration or microformats (kritX, blogcritics and iNods all require one or both of these). This is a harder problem to solve because they need to go through every blog post and figure out what is relevant to their service.</p>, <p>Structured blogging initiatives and/or blogger registration certainly make it easier for services like this to recognize and gather the specific edge content they are looking for, I do not believe it is necessary. Existing tagging and syndication platforms are all the tools these vertical search engines need.</p>, <p>There is no way centralized review sites like Yelp, Riffs, Judy’s Book and others can compete with the blogosphere over the long run. Those sites will also have to gather decentralized content, or become meaningless.

VMWare Update: Two Rough Quarters,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.vmare.com""><img alt="""" class=""shot2"" src=""http://www.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0001/9593/19593v1-max-250x250.png""/></a></p>, <p><a href=""http://vmware.com/"">VMWare</a>, is best known as a market leader in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization"">virtualization software</a>, a type of software that simulates hardware for the purpose of separating a computer’s operating system from its hardware. For the consumer this allows one computer to run multiple operating systems, like Apple computers running Windows. For enterprise users, virtualization lets them run multiple virtual servers off of one physical server. However the software maker cannot seem to catch a break.</p>, <p>Research by <a href=""http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS21473108&amp;pageType=PRINTFRIENDLY"">IDC</a>, and first reported by <a href=""http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9117398&amp;intsrc=news_ts_head"">ComputerWorld</a>, shows that VMWare’s market share of the enterprise X86 virtualization market fell from a <a href=""http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/101608-microsoft-vmware-gap-narrows.html"">reported 51%</a> during 2007 to 44% during the third quarter of 2008. At the same time <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com"">Microsoft’s</a><a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/hyperv.aspx"">Hyper-V</a> virtualization product has already had a material impact on Microsoft’s market share, even though the product was only released three months ago, as Microsoft’s market share jumped to 23% during the third quarter, up from 18% in the first quarter of 2008.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/vmware"">VMWare</a> has not only lost a significant amount of market share in dramatic fashion, but also has lost a significant quantity of senior talent and share holder value. According to <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSN1951286120080919"">Reuters</a> and the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/09/technology/09vmware.html?partner=rssyahoo&amp;emc=rss"">New York Times</a>, since September 1st,  VMWare has lost Richard Sarwal, their Executive Vice President for Research and Development, Mendel Rosenblum, a Co-Founder and their Chief Scientist, and Paul Chan, their VP for Product Development. As of the market’s close on Friday VMWare was trading at $20.69 per share, less than a sixth of its 52-Week high of $125.25 per share, and having lost more than 75% of its share price year to date. This comes after a tumultuous summer which saw VMWare’s founding CEO, <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/diane-greene"">Diane Greene</a>, forced out by the board of its parent company, <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/emccorporation"">EMC</a>, resulting in VMWare shares <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2008/07/08/vmware-drops-25-of-market-cap/"">losing 25% of their value</a> in one day.<a href=""http://charts.wikinvest.com/WikiChartMini.swf"">http://charts.wikinvest.com/WikiChartMini.swf</a></p>, <p>Given the current economic climate, VMWare should be doing better than ever. With the growth of Apple’s Intel based computer platform people are using VMWare’s <a href=""http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/"">Fusion</a>software, and its competitor <a href=""http://www.parallels.com/"">Parallels Desktop</a>, to boot Windows on Apple hardware. But more importantly in the current economic downturn, one way that organizations will squeeze more computing power out of existing hardware is to spend budgets on virtualization software rather than on new servers. This is because virtualization lets enterprises deploy multiple virtual computers on a single set of hardware while simultaneously maximizing hardware utilization and consolidating resources.  This is why virtualization was ranked <a href=""http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=777212"">one of the top ten strategic technologies to watch in 2009</a> according to <a href=""http://www.gartner.com"">Gartner</a>. As further evidence of the growth in the virtualization market, IDC noted that virtualization shipments increased a staggering 53% between the second quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2008. With enterprise grade products like <a href=""http://www.vmware.com/products/server/"">VMWare Server</a> and <a href=""http://www.vmware.com/products/esxi/"">VMWare ESXi</a>, the company seemed well positioned to make the most of the current economic situation.</p>, <p>The introduction of Hyper-V, which is priced extremely competitively, in combination with senior management turn over and slumping share prices has caused VMWare to be downgraded by at least  three different investment houses (<a href=""http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/commentary/observations.aspx?ID=88224"">1</a>, <a href=""http://www.marketintelligencecenter.com/articles/677358"">2</a>, &amp; <a href=""http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2008/10/03/software-weisel-turns-cautious-cuts-many-estimates/"">3</a>) in the past month. This combination of factors seems to be the perfect storm to disrupt VMWare from being able to take advantage of the opportunities which the current economic duress could have afforded it.

Cingular 8525 Hands On,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""center"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/November%202006/IMG_3704.jpg""/><br/>
If you read my <a href=""http://crunchgear.com/2006/11/03/smartphones-now-10-things-i-hate-about-smartphones/"">10 Things I Hate About Smartphones</a> post last week, you’d discover that I hate Windows Mobile and that, even though they run <a href=""http://crunchgear.com/2006/11/02/smartphones-now-windows-mobile-5/"">Windows Mobile</a>, I love HTC. So with that piece of cognitive dissonance in mind, I present my review of the Cingular 8525 aka the Hermes, a Windows Mobile Pocket PC smartphone with fold out QWERTY keyboard and touchscreen. It costs $399 with contract.<br/>
<span id=""more-593""></span><br/>
<img class=""center"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/November%202006/IMG_3703.jpg""/><br/>
<i><small>The Dash vs. the 8525</small></i></p>, <p>Let’s begin at the beginning. HTC has been making PDAs and PDA-like phones for a number of years, both as an OEM for companies like HP as well as under carrier brands. The T-Mobile <a href=""http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/Detail.aspx?device=8802ddeb-1ee4-477a-9608-d9cd1e2a903f"">MDA</a> and SDA, for example, are two phones from the HTC line up. The MDA and Cingular’s own 8125, in fact, are the direct progenitors of the 8525.<br/>
<img class=""center"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/November%202006/IMG_3699.jpg""/></p>, <p>A smartphone with a touchscreen is inherently better. Although many OSes and applications work well with a keypad/directional key set-up, a touchscreen makes things so much easier to navigate. That is why I like the 8525, even for all its bulk.</p>, <p>Why is the 8525 so bulky? It contains multitudes: WiFi, Bluetooth, EDGE/GPRS, international 3G compatibility, and, get this, HSDPA. That means you can essentially get connected at high speeds anywhere in the world. Cingular offers a $45 data plan and surfing on this thing, especially with <a href=""http://crunchgear.com/2006/11/02/smartphones-now-opera-mini-2-opens-up-real-mobile-web-browsing/"">Opera Mini 2</a>, is a dream. Messaging is even better because the 8525 has a huge keypad with ginormous, flat keys that are easy to press and are fairly intuitive. The OS itself, for all  my hatred, is acceptable and there are a number of applications available for Pocket PC edition that won’t work on WinMo 5.0 Smartphone Edition. So there’s that.</p>, <p>It supports a number of mail formats including standard POP/IMAP connections to push email through Good.

"1000Tags – Another Stupid, Brilliant Idea","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>I was talking with an entrepreneur earlier today about about <a href=""http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/"">milliondollarhomepage</a> and what a simple, brilliant concept it is. It’s one of those things that will really only work once (although I have some further thoughts on that below).</p>, <p><a href=""http://1000tags.com"">1000Tags</a> is different enough from MillionDollarHomePage that I think it will have a lot of sucess, too. They call it “the first commercial tag cloud”. And that’s exactly what it it. You can purchase a tag, pay by the character and font size, and hope that a lot of traffic to your site is the result.</p>, <p>They are selling up to 1,000 tags. Tags can be exclusive (click the Star Wars tag), but cost significantly more, and they will only sell 50 of them. The remaining tags link to a results page with what appears to be an unlimited number of results (click the Download Music tag).</p>, <p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong><br/>
The price goes like this (in US$):</p>, <p>    * For shared tags, the price is $5 per character, but with a minimum of $25 even if your tag is less than 5 characters, which is ok since most tags will use at least 5 characters. Also, since the maximum tag size is 20 characters, the maximum price for a shared tag is $100</p>, <p>    * Exclusive tags cost $250 upfront just for making them “exclusive”. Then, the price goes up depending on the number of characters and font size. It can get expensive if you use up lots of characters and a very large font size. Remember, exclusive tags are expensive not because we’re greedy but because we’d rather people book shared tags.</p>, <p>Like MDH, this site is a proof of concept that cannot be easily copied. Duplicate sites will clearly not have the ability to get the same level of attention. However, I do think already established websites could add a commercial tag cloud, or MDH-like banner area for logos, and generate (one time?) revenue from it. Perhaps 1000tags and MDH could even supply the APIs and service to do this.</p>, <p>Is this an incredibly cool new web 2.0 business? No. But it is a smart idea that I wish I had thought of and executed on. Good for them.</p>, <p>Thanks, Luis Salfro, for emailing me about this.</p>]"

When Will Yahoo Acquire Technorati?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Yahoo’s recent acquisition binge is the topic of a Red Herring print article this week called “Hungry Hungry Yahoo”. Liz Gannes, who wrote the article, discusses Yahoo’s recent acquisitions and speculates on a few likely candidates for future Yahoo shopping sprees. The article lists 37 Signals, MeasureMap, Digg, YouTube and Technorati as the ones to watch. (Note: Liz interviewed me for this article last month and I am quoted in it)</p>, <p>Liz goes on to write that Technorati is the most likely to be bought:</p>, <p>But most of all, Technorati would perfectly align with Yahoo’s recent espousal of tagging. Technorati created the de facto standard for introducing tags into blog posts; it uses teh tags to improve its searches.</p>, <p>CEO Dave Sifry’s response?</p>, <p>When Red Herring called Technorati CEO David Sifry to confirm the revelation, his response was…”No comment.”</p>, <p>Well, “no comment” be damned, I believe that Yahoo <em>should,</em> and even <em>may,</em> acquire Technorati in the near future.</p>, <p><u>First of all</u>, Yahoo has already acquired the “fraternal twins” of tagging – Flickr and <a href=""//www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/12/09/yahoo-acquires-delicious/"">Del.icio.us</a>. Both were pioneers in their respective markets, and relatively cheap ($20 – $30 million each). Flickr made tagging of pictures popular; Del.icio.us did the same with bookmarks.</p>, <p>But Flickr and Del.icio.us are not twins. They are tagging triplets along with Technorati, which created and popularized blog tagging in 2005. Today, the majority of blogs use tags and categories to label their posts.</p>, <p><u>Second</u>, Technorati should be just about out of money. They raised a speculated $14 million in the summer of 2004 from Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Mobius Venture Capital and August Capital. If they’ve raised more since then it has not been announced (or leaked). I know of a few unannounced financings, but I have not heard anything about Technorati raising additional venture capital. Technorati may need money.</p>, <p><u>Third</u>, Yahoo’s blog search <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/10/yahoo-blog-search/"">isn’t great</a>. Technorati’s blog search is the best on the web right now after much needed upgrades over the last six months.</p>, <p>So, in my opinion, an acquisition makes sense. Stephen Baker at Business Week <a href=""http://blogs.businessweek.com/the_thread/blogspotting/archives/2005/12/2006_prediction.html"">thinks Microsoft</a> will be the suitor. But it’s got to be Yahoo.</p>, <p>Why won’t it happen? Given today’s funding environment Technorati may be (or have already) raised additional funds to take them to the next level. And given an approximate $30 million valuation even back in 2004, it would take a much larger acquisition than the $30-$50 million we are seeing in deals today to get them. Technorati’s VCs just wouldn’t pull the trigger, and they certainly have veto rights over an acquisition.</p>, <p>In the end, I just <em>want</em> this to happen. The tagging triplets need to be under one roof.</p>]"

Along the way, I have been both a cheerleader for all of the building blocks of the new “open stack” (including OpenID, OAuth, XRDS-Simple, microformats, Portable Contacts, and OpenSocial) and one of the most vocal critics of Facebook. Over the past two years, I have never missed a chance to point out Facebook’s absence from any key event or announcement around the “open” movement. And I’ve tried many different techniques to encourage Facebook down the open path, some more <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2008/01/03/plaxo-flubs-it/"">controversial</a> than others.</p>, <p>But I had an “aha moment” on Monday of this week at a rather historic event that could only happen in Silicon Valley – a User Experience (UX) Summit for OpenID which brought together representatives from Google, Yahoo, MySpace, Microsoft, AOL, Plaxo, and others. The stated reason for assembling this group, most of whom are in direct competition with each other, was in reaction to recent usability studies on OpenID (one by <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2008/10/open_id_research.html"">Yahoo</a> and one by <a href=""http://sites.google.com/site/oauthgoog/UXFedLogin/CombineGoogYahoo"">Google</a>), which made it clear that the current implementations of OpenID are confusing to mainstream users. The unstated reason that fifty of us packed together, shoulder-to-shoulder, was to muster a collective response to Facebook Connect.</p>, <p>You see, it’s been about a month since the first implementation of Facebook Connect was <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2008/09/19/facebook-connect-spotted-in-the-wild-will-beacon-finally-die/"">spotted in the wild </a>over at CBS’s celebrity gossip site, TheInsider.com. Want to sign up for the site? Click a single button. A little Facebook window pops up to confirm that you want to connect via your Facebook account. One more click – and you’re done. You’ve got a new account, a mini profile with your Facebook photo, and access to that subset of your Facebook friends who have also connected their accounts to TheInsider. Oh, and you can have your activities on TheInsider flow into your Facebook news feed automatically. All that, without having to create and remember a new username/password pair for the site. Why, it’s just like the vision for OpenID and the Open Stack – except without a single open building block under the hood!</p>, <p>And so this past weekend I found myself looking forward to Monday’s UX Summit with a mixture of optimism and great urgency. On Sunday, I tweeted that I was excited to be going. I was stunned by the first response to come back just a few minutes later, from my friend Dave Morin, of Facebook Platform fame, “Agreed! The OpenID UX Summit is going to be awesome tomorrow. Looking forward to it.” I had heard that Facebook had been invited, but, honestly, I really didn’t know if they were going to send anyone. Then I looked at the confirmed attendee list, and saw three other heavy-hitters from Facebook were signed up: Josh Elman, Mike Vernal, and Julie Zhuo, all, like Dave, key players on the Facebook Connect initiative. “That’s very interesting,” I thought…</p>, <p>Monday morning came, and I saddled up with Joseph Smarr and the rest of the Plaxo crew and headed over to Yahoo. After the intros, Allen Tom of Yahoo, who organized the event, turned the first session over Max Engel of MySpace, who in turn suggested an alternative – why not let Facebook’s Julie Zhuo kick it off instead? And for the next hour, Julie took us through the details of Facebook Connect and the decisions they had to make along the way to get the user interface and user experience just right. It was not just a presentation; it was a very active and engaged discussion, with questions popping up from all over the room. Julie and the rest of the Facebook team were engaged and eager to share what they had learned.</p>, <p>What the heck is going on here? Is Facebook preparing to go the next step of open, switching from the FB stack to the Open Stack? Only time will tell. But one thing is clear: Facebook Connect is the best thing ever for OpenID (and the rest of the Open Stack). Why? Because Facebook has set a high bar with Facebook Connect that is inspiring everyone in the open movement to work harder and faster to bring up the quality of the UI/UX for OpenID and the Open Stack.</p>, <p>The day was very productive, with sessions led by Max Engel of MySpace, Eric Sachs of Google, and Joseph Smarr of Plaxo, among others. Right before lunch there was a rising chorus to form a small working group to develop a common UI spec for OpenID. Hands raised include Chris Messina (Vidoop), Joseph Smarr (Plaxo), Eric Sachs (Google), Max Engel (MySpace), and, drumroll, Julie Zhuo (Facebook).</p>, <p>Later in the day, there was a spirited debate about OpenID as a URL (as originally envisioned) vs. a new proposal to extend the spec to allow email addresses to be OpenIDs. Mike Jones from Microsoft was eloquent on the security risks of the email address approach. At one point, I thought the debate might devolve into chaos, but Dick Hardt, who delivered the infamous “Identity 2.0” keynote at OSCON three years ago, helped bring focus, “You have seen the competition; it is Facebook Connect. That is the new bar that we must meet.” The discussion found its way to constructive next steps; a few more folks joined the UI working group, and shortly after 5:00, the historic summit was adjourned.

Dogster Turns Two,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.dogster.com"">Dogster</a>, led by founder and CEO Ted Rheingold, turned <a href=""http://www.dogster.com/site_updates.php?p=218"">two years old</a> yesterday. The company is located in San Francisco.</p>, <p>Dogster is a home page site just for dogs. You can see the page for my dog, Laguna, <a href=""http://www.dogster.com/pet_page.php?j=t&amp;i=225571"">here</a> as an example. A key part of the site is social interaction among dogs, and Laguna has a number of “friends” that are linked on the page. Dogster also allows tagging of photos, and has just launched a Groups feature (there are already 239 Groups) In general, humans do not interact and you do not know who the dogs’ owners are. For a lot of dog-crazy owners, this is perfect.</p>, <p>Needless to say, Dogster has some pretty loyal users, and the site statistics reflect this:</p>, <p>Dogster even has a <a href=""http://www.dogster.com/travel/"">search engine</a> for dog friendly hotels.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>The story of Dogster is great, too. Ted was out of work and taking odd jobs here and there, and decided to just follow a dream and create the site. Within 3 months the site was cash flow positive and by month 18 Dogster was profitable. The company never raised outside funds other than from friends and family</p>, <p>Dogster generates revenue from premium accounts ($20 per year), advertising, and sponsorships both on the side and for things like “<a href=""http://www.dogster.com/show/"">The World’s Coolest Dog and Cat Show</a>“, which was sponsored by Target, Nintendo and others.

Results can be listed by date or relevancy.</p>, <p>Users can listen to podcasts direclty from the search results, or download the file. Users can also subscribe to the feed or the search results via RSS.</p>, <p>This is where I ran into problems. A “killer” feature of Podzinger is the ability to listen just to the snippet that contains the search term. Links appear within the result that can be clicked on to hear the snippet. I see the links and click on them, but cannot get a single one to play.</p>, <p>This issue is addressed in the FAQs, and it suggest either using Real Player or being patient. However, I am getting actual errors, not just long delays.</p>, <p><strong><br/>
When I click on a snippet, why is there sometimes a long delay from the time I hit play until the time I hear the audio playing?</strong><br/>
Most media players including Quicktime require that the file be downloaded before play begins. You should not experience this delay with RealPlayer, since it supports something called the Range feature of the HTTP1.1 protocol that makes it possible to begin playing almost immediately at any point in an audio file. </p>, <p>Assuming they get this working properly, it’s a great way to search for content within podcasts and other audio files. A perfect new feature would be the ability for publishers and users to tag additional content within the file and allow others to jump right to that.</p>, <p>Also, Podzinger is obviously fully transcribing the podcasts…although I cannot seem to find the full transcriptions anywhere. If the transcription exists and has a permanent URL, I imagine podcasters would link to it like crazy.</p>, <p>Podzinger is supported by advertising and is also rolling out a cost-per-click product to allow podcasters to sell advertising into transcripts.</p>]"

These moves to strengthen EC2 (offering service-level guarantees, load balancing, monitoring, and support for instances of Microsoft Windows and SQL Server) are steps aimed at appeasing Big IT—the IT managers who run big corporate data centers and still need convincing that they won’t get fired for offloading their corporate computation needs to the Web.</p>, <p>But this is where the winds are blowing.  If you want to know what’s next in IT, all you need to do is follow Andy Bechtolsheim.  One of the original founders of Sun Microsystems, who then moved on to found several other startups including Granite Systems, he became a bigwig at Cisco after it acquired Granite, and then returned to Sun to help save it from extinction.  Now he is turning his attention to Arista (renamed today from Arastra), where he is chairman and chief development officer.

Realtime wars pick up speed,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/tron_lightcycles.jpg""/></p>, <p>Thursday night Twitter engineer Alex Payne finally <a href=""http://dev.twitter.com/2008/10/we-got-data.html"">acknowledged</a> the obvious regarding the firehose – the full stream of data sought after by third-party developers to add back the long-withheld Track service. Twitter executives have been all over the map on this, sending developers on a wild goose chase to obtain access to the XMPP stream that the company has failed to provide since May.</p>, <p>Payne’s post describes how Twitter provided the firehose “on an experimental basis some months ago, but had to limit its distribution to just a few subscribers while we worked on technical hurdles.” At BearHug Camp, developers were told to contact Gnip as an intermediary, but now Payne says Twitter has decided to keep the service in-house with a newly-staffed team and yet another undetermined delta between promise and reality.</p>, <p>Friendfeed’s realtime beta service and promised improvements in auto-provisioning of Friend Lists may have done more than all the BearHugging and developer consternation combined to smoke Twitter out. While Twitter tap dances and stonewalls, Friendfeed releases a steady stream of features that, in aggregate, add up to a whole lot more than promises and lipstick back-pedaling. <a href=""http://blog.friendfeed.com/2008/10/friendfeed-room-upgrades.html"">Today</a>, for example, Friendfeed Rooms were transformed into a comment management system:</p>, <p>Room admins can also now choose whether they want comment moderation on their semi-public rooms. This can be particularly useful if you want to embed your room on your own web site. When commenting in a moderated room, a user will see “Pending” before their unapproved comment, and will also have the option of editing or deleting the comment without needing to wait for an admin to approve or reject it. Room admins will see the approval-pending comments at the top of that room and also in the entries themselves.</p>, <p>This leverages the new realtime features as well as the embeddable widget option to receive such a room feed. It also solves one of Friendfeed’s most fundamental problems, namely the siloing of the comment stream. Not only can rooms be used to aggregate comments, the widget lets you spread the comments around in context of blogs, portals, and other social networks. In one fell swoop, Disqus, coComment, and even other aggregation points such as Microsoft Sharepoint become objects looking smaller than real size in the rear view mirror.</p>, <p>Friendfeed becomes a conversation hub that can be threaded through Twitter and other micromessaging platforms at the cost of a tinyurl. What we’re seeing here are the primitives needed to assemble conversational routing at the micromessage level, something that is more valuable to Twitter users than the limited realtime tools available from the Mother Ship. Friendfeed is in a real conversation with its developers, in contrast to the snipe hunt Twitter keeps sending its developers on, only to admit they are really just buying time until they can figure out how to keep the ideas in-house.</p>, <p>Twitter’s bigger problem is that Track is a commodity once Twitter finally releases it. Regardless of its cost to users – which will likely be subsidized by advertising models – the benefits of tracking a notification service for valuable conversations held and managed by users on a competitive network are also commoditized. The longer Twitter waits to get into the game, the more valuable Friendfeed rooms and conversation streams become and the more opportunity for Friendfeed to release its own Track.</p>, <p>Friend List modeling will then become the analog to Twitter Follows, and Rooms a way of aggregating discovery of new friends. Track across both spaces with realtime output and API messaging back out to Twitter will be hard to compete against, especially when Friendfeed is using Twitter as its viral marketing tool. And history is telling us the only thing likely to get Twitter moving is competition. That they now have in spades.</p>]"

Now this is the trick to the whole system – it doesn’t just grab the 1-10 numerical scores. ViewScores patented process actually parses the review for positive and negative language and uses that to produce the majority of its final score. That’s right – they have a robo-critic who distills reviews to their barest essentials and then figures out if the reviewer hated the product or was raving about it.</p>, <p>“We took a Sony press release and put it into the system and it got the highest score because everything was positive,” said Ami Zivov, CTO of the Tel Aviv-based company. “But when we put in a professional review, it gets a mix of positive and negative.”</p>, <p>The site also obviously has sale links near the bottom and usually creates a set of 5 or six scores and allows you to “suggest” a review to be added into the mix. Finally, you get an average score (between 1 and 100) and a star score and general “mood” score (“Good”, “Excellent”) for those so inclined.</p>, <p>The database is fairly hefty right now, with quite a few gadgets already processed and ranked.

This is far short of MySpace’s 50ish million, of course, but it is impressive growth.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>Tagworld is taking a decentralized approach to video. Users may upload video in just about any format directly to their TagWorld storage (all users are given a gb of storage to use for video, music and any other type of file). Alternatively, videos from <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/08/08/profile-youtube/"">YouTube</a> and other video sharing sites can be “bookmarked” directly into the My Videos area, and/or directly into the user’s TagWorld page for streaming to visitors.</p>, <p>I have not seen a solution that offers both uploading and bookmarking functionality, allowing users to choose to upload or just point to another site for video. This seems like an evolutionary step forward to me.</p>, <p>Since TagWorld is also operating a virtual storage service as well by giving users a gb of free storage, they’ve developed a client based uploader tool to handle large files and folders. TagWorld automatically detects if a file is music/audio, video, or another type of file and categorizes it approriately. If a user uploads a folder containing a video, and song and a word document, those files are places in My Music, My Video and My Files, accordingly. Again, I’ve not seen this on any other service. A mac client is in development.</p>, <p>The Uploader is live now, Video goes live tomorrow morning around 9 am.</p>]"

Last night at Neil Young’s Bridge concert, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff came back from a trip to Young’s dressing room and murmured something to the effect that something amazing was about to happen. He was right: Young’s set climaxed with a stunning version of the Beatles’ A Day in the Life. Easily the best live version of arguably the pinnacle of the Beatle arc, the performance caught the audience by surprise and then repeatedly topped that with waves of power, cacophony, strange beauty, and a fearless reveling in the opportunity of the near future.</p>, <p>Earlier, Benioff did his usual priming of the pump about Salesforce’ Dreamforce developer conference next week in San Francisco. I’d been tipped by his PR team that something interesting was up, but Marc is famously very careful these days about letting cats out of the bag. What he would say, however, seemed coincident and at the same time resonant with the Neil Young performance: namely, that whatever will be announced is a new direction for Salesforce, something that may surprise, something that though unexpected might harness the power of the disruptive intersection of unanticipated combinations.</p>, <p>Perhaps I’m reading into this, but then we’ve earned the right to dream a little in this unnerving time of collapse and chaos. Tomorrow Ray Ozzie takes the stage in Los Angeles to flesh out the scope and design of Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, and I for one am looking forward to it. It may not be popular to cheer Microsoft on; as Benioff suggests, Redmond is still the big dog in the technology industry. Salesforce may align more naturally with Google, Amazon, and others, but without a strong Microsoft to promote and tilt against, you get the sense Benioff, Schmidt, Ellison, and the rest would have to invent someone else.</p>, <p>I think something different, that today’s competitive landscape requires a strong Microsoft, a real power in its strategy, not just the old paranoia about lock in and the Windows/Office tax. In a world of Novell and Netscape and Lotus, sure – Microsoft’s control of the desktop meant annihilation. In a world of Google, Cisco, Oracle, and a growing coalition of cloud vendors led by Amazon, there is no clear cataclysmic victory to contemplate. Apple alone makes clear the reality that there’s a market not just for momentum but excellence, and in a tortured economy, excellence will win its share.</p>, <p>That’s the key to what Ozzie will unveil, just how open the platform is to developer investment in its primitives. What little we know so far says a lot – Silverlight built on a three-legged stool of Windows, OS/X, and Linux, Mesh a signaling layer to abstract the new uber-platform from desktop to desktop+ Web, and tooling to orchestrate a new behavioral people-oriented search model as the economic underpinning.</p>, <p>The one thing Microsoft no longer has: the ability to stop the flow of other bits across the network. Sun fought for years to push Java onto the desktop. Adobe came in the back way with animation. Cisco rules at the deep packet layer. And Google and Apple control the imagination layer. So what do they, or we, have to fear from Microsoft? Start with the weakest and work out from there.</p>, <p>Adobe’s Flash bits gateway is seemingly the most vulnerable. Forget Silverlight – the real battleground is the mobile space, where Apple is maintaining a blockade that will be difficult to dislodge given the iPhone’s still-growing success. Android may help, but Google has more juice in its control of a mobile productivity suite via the iPhone + Android to risk Steve Jobs’ wrath. And Chrome on Android with Chrome technology baked into Safari, Firefox, and even a Mesh-enabled IE creates a bit pump that makes Adobe look like a third world country.</p>, <p>The religious arguments against all this will certainly have some effect, with anti-Microsoft rhetoric making it difficult for developers to stick their toes in the water. But with layoffs mounting and startup money moving toward credible revenue, Microsoft’s control of IT spending will keep developers in place as virtualization slipstreams the new platform in under cover of security and governance requirements. Microsoft in effect becomes IT’s bulwark against the ongoing encroachment of on-demand outsourcing – read Salesforce, Oracle, and likely Amazon as they move into applications.</p>, <p>It’s almost as though Microsoft has waited long enough for this economic meltdown to let market triage do its heavy lifting for them. But no matter how vulnerable elements of the anti-Microsoft coalition may be, individual collapses are unlikely to disrupt the march to at least two credible bit pump platforms – and whoever has unrestricted access to the Net has an equal chance of capturing behavior and therefore the efficiency of realtime relevance. With that comes a major stake in the new media restructuring, where the old three network pattern reemerges with Google, Microsoft, and Apple as the new ABC, CBS, and NBC.</p>, <p>It may not play out this way, but I don’t mind being called out as a Hippie for Obama or one who’s rooting for Microsoft to pull this off. I’ve been rooting for Google all along, and Salesforce and Amazon too. I wouldn’t have bet on what Neil Young and his band pulled off last night, but he and they, and we, did. I read the news today, oh boy.</p>]"

On the Future of Non-Exploding Batteries,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img align=""left"" class=""right""/>A manager I once knew had an axiom: if it’s got a cable, it’s not really a gadget.

Now, anything less than three hours is cause for a riot.</p>, <p>The real problem this kind of advance induces is that as batteries reach higher capacities and performance metrics, they get more dangerous. <a href=""http://crunchgear.com/2006/08/25/sony-apologizes-for-burning-your-pants-blames-self/"" target=""_blank"">Last week’s recalls</a> of millions of exploding Sony laptop batteries is a blistering, literally in some case, reminder of what happens when the envelope is pushed beyond reason simply to satiate business models.</p>, <p>Yet-Ming Chiang, an MIT scientist and the brains behind a new battery startup, says in <a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17382&amp;ch=biztech"" target=""_blank"">this interview with Technology Review</a> that the future has non-exploding laptop batteries for us.

The company feed is <a href=""http://jeroen.feedxs.com/The%20FeedXS%20feed"">here</a>, for instance.

Highly-configurable models, avoid the entry levels with their Celeron-based processors and opt for the Centrino Duo, and you’ve got a pretty decent bang for your buck, especially with the SXGA 15.4″ LCD, built-in wireless, and 5.5-pound weight.</p>, <p>NEC laptops are nice, but are not the kind of things that gets us geeks drooling.

Let people easily create social applications tailored with difference web services. Allow others to clone those applications and take the code from them directly into whatever they are building instead of building from scratch. Watch everything evolve as better and better stuff gets built, which in turn is used to build even better stuff. Ning leverages the platform by aggregating the applications and selling advertising and premium tools/features.</p>, <p>But the reality of Ning is that it’s lost whatever coolness it had, no one uses it and Ning is going to have a very hard time getting people’s attention when they finally do roll out better functionality.</p>, <p>Here’s are the problems:<br/>
<u><br/>
</u><u>First</u>, You have to know PHP, or at least HTML, to build anything unique on Ning. They <a href=""http://faq.ning.com/group.php?FAQGroup:title=Building+Apps+on+Ning#faq-147271"">promise to create tools</a> to allow non-programmers to build stuff in the future, but for now, 99.9% of the Internet population is effectively locked out from creating new stuff.</p>, <p><u>Second</u>, there is no support for the <a href=""http://www.programmableweb.com/matrix"">key web service APIs</a> out there that people are really excited about mashing up. Instead, Ning has created a suite of <a href=""http://www.ning.com/?view=xapps"">custom applications</a>…but which lack the scalability and functionality of what’s out there on the open web.</p>, <p>Yes, you can pull in services like Google Maps if you have the programming skills to do so (see <a href=""http://bayareahikingtrails.ning.com/dispatcher.php?controller=welcome&amp;action=show"">here</a> for an example), but Ning does not pull these in as modules to get you started, which would be really compelling.</p>, <p><u>Third</u>, Ning keeps all of the applications under the ning.com roof. This has benefits like free hosting, but application creators don’t get control of the page to add advertising and they cannot get user registration data direclty. Users create a Ning account to use the mashups. That’s great for really small time stuff, but no one serious will build on the platform.</p>, <p><u>Fourth</u>, Ning did everything wrong in communicating with their users. At first they called it 24hourLaundry and no one knew what Ning would be. With the benefit of hindsight, this looks silly. No one was rushing to launch anything similar, and in fact telling users about their plans and getting feedback would have helped them build a better product.</p>, <p>Even today, the <a href=""http://blog.ning.com/"">Ning blog</a> focuses on highlighting mashups, none of which are that great, instead of telling users when new and better features and tools will be released.

Microsoft offers cloud computing a hearty handclasp,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><span class=""embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video"" style=""text-align:center; display: block;""><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" class=""youtube-player"" height=""360"" sandbox=""allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tr90_pqtZmg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent"" style=""border:0;"" width=""640""></iframe></span></p>, <p>Microsoft and Ray Ozzie cracked the door half open this morning on Windows Azure, the infrastructure formerly known as Windows Cloud. In the process, Ozzie served notice that IT will remain in the Windows/Office grip but with an abstraction layer that blurs the on-premise and on-demand worlds.</p>, <p>The outlines of Live Mesh’s role as arbiter of this abstraction were there to be inferred, but the details of how the Azure service bus arbitrates things like federated identity, workflow services, and overall services management will be left to Tuesday’s keynote. But the leisure with which Ozzie and his lieutenants roll out the announcements belies the speed with which Microsoft is executing this corner turn.</p>, <p>It’s called a community technology preview as a nod to the coveted developer crowd, with code distributed along with a freeze on cost that will likely last well into 2009. While that’s standard operating procedure for most platforms in this beta-is-rtm world, the inclusion of Dynamics CRM apps hosted in the cloud is at a minimum a shot across Salesforce’s bow.</p>, <p>A smidgen of Silverlight messaging glinted around the edges of the demos – colorful graphics and a cloud data-based auto-generated chart that popped up on Sharepoint Online. Where once Office Online seemed a pathetic attempt to escape the Office political vortex, now it’s starting to look more like an aggressive strategy to lock IT in and let IT manage users. The bet appears to be that offloading enough infrastructure costs from the enterprise will let Microsoft siphon services revenue as a condition of rapid transformation to more efficient cloud services.</p>, <p>We’ll need to wait for more details to decide how competitive the  cloud play is, but Ozzie telegraphed one potential outcome when he thanked Amazon for pioneering the space with its cloud offerings. It certainly was sincere, but there was no mistaking the virtual gold watch, the famous proffered hearty handclasp, and the well-oiled “We’ll take it from here.”</p>]"
BillMonk – Social Money,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.billmonk.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a><a href=""https://www.billmonk.com"">BillMonk</a> is a new service that allows people to easily keep track of financial debts among friends. It’s a simple idea and they’ve executed well.</p>, <p>The idea is a user who wants to report a debt owed to him or her (such as a shared bill), or an IOU to another person, simply enters it on BillMonk. This is very easy to do on BillMonk, even for more complicated transactions like a bill shared among a lot of people. You simply input the amount of the bill and the email addresses for those who participated. There is also an SMS feature to allow users to text in bills on the phone.</p>, <p>I like the way BillMonk keeps track of all of the various transactions a user has with different people, and the current amount owed at any given time. For instance, if I buy dinner for my friend <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/orliy1/sets/357742/"">Orli Yakuel</a> and we decide to split the $100 bill, and later I owe her $8 for coffee, BillMonk knows that she only owes me a total of $42.

Srivastava confirmed that one of the demos featured a glimpse of an online version of Microsoft Word.</p>, <p>Muglia and Ozzie reminisced briefly of problems in Hailstorm that still aren’t solved with Azure. Muglia credited Identity architect Kim Cameron with important work in identity federation that is just now seeing the light of day in Azure’s automated identity provisioning.

He suggested apps developed during Azure’s community preview release beta will be much more important in driving the cloud platform forward.</p>, <p>Ozzie is actually encouraged that Amazon is in the game, saying he doesn’t know what competitors will do. But as a competitor of Microsoft before his current job, he notes: “The moment that Exchange was launched, Notes took off.

But they also released a website service that is totally awesome.</p>, <p>The FireAnt site is now a full videoblogging directory that allows users to tag and rate videoblogs, subscribe to feeds and queue them up for watching or downloading. You can also watch any videoblog directly on the website in its original file format (this last point is important).</p>, <p>The website and clients fully syncronize, so any videoblogs added or removed from your que on the site will automatically sync up with the client (users may use the website at work, and have the client installed at home along with their PSP, video iPod or other device).</p>, <p>The result is an extremely versatile, file-type-agnostic videoblogging ecosystem. A tool like this was needed to allow videoblogging to expand to more users.</p>, <p>FireAnt works closely with other videoblogging services like <a href=""http://www.mefeedia.com/"">Mefeedia</a> (a directory and aggregator) and <a href=""http://blip.tv/"">Blip.tv</a> (a service which, among other things, provides a great platform for videobloggers to host their content) to ensure that they are all launching compatible platform and application services. This coopetition is good for the industry. Let’s see how long it can last. :-)</p>, <p>FireAnt has relocated from New York to San Francisco. Joshua Kinberg and Jay Dedman are the founders (there are seven or so employees now).</p>, <p>Jay also worked with Mefeedia founder Peter Van Dijk to form the first video blogging email list before either company was founded. They are now tracking nearly 5,000 legitimate video blogs…up from only a handful a year ago.</p>]"
CrunchGear's Back to School Cheat Sheet,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""center"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/back2school.jpg""/></p>, <p>September is here and maybe you or someone in your household–you know, the kid upstairs with the headphones who listens to that demon hippity-hop music?–might be in the market for some back to school technology. Here’s a quick rundown of our favorite picks from the past few months.<br/>

Media players have become a staple amongst students. This is an overly congested field, but the <a href=""http://www.viewscore.com/product_page.php?productID=1312&amp;categoryID=23&amp;str=ipod%20video"">iPod Video</a> (about $350) still retains a majority of the market share. With 60GB of hard drive space you can fit quite a few episodes of “The Hills” and still have room to burn. There are some rumors that Apple will be upgrading the iPod in either September or November, so if you simply can’t wait to get one of these, be prepared for a bit of buyer’s remorse.</p>, <p>Creative is also launching a slew of handheld media devices including the <a href=""http://crunchgear.com/2006/08/31/creative-zen-vision-w-is-official/"">Zen Vision W</a> with 4.5-inch screen for movies. It should be available in September and comes in 30GB or 60GB versions.</p>, <p>Another gadget to consider is the <a href=""http://crunchgear.com/2006/08/31/sirius-stiletto-100-shows-some-skin/"">Sirius Stiletto 100</a>, a portable media player that picks up Sirius satellite radio signals and, most importantly, Howard Stern. It will cost $399 and will be available this month.</p>, <p>A great feature about most smartphones is that they can also be used as a portable modem for your laptop. Even if you’re out of range of a WiFi hotspot, you can still get broadband-like speeds with EV-DO or EDGE. Some of the newer smartphones even feature real 3G speeds, equalling, or even surpassing, many DSL modems. With subscriptions for these data plans starting at less than most home broadband connections, WiFi almost becomes redundant. Almost.</p>, <p>The Treo, by Palm, has almost become the standard that other smartphones are held to. The easy-to-use Qwerty keyboard makes the learning curve a soft one. From a features standpoint, there’s not much not to like about the Treo, and the fanbase backs that up. The built-in software gives you email, web browsing and MP3 playback. It is also capable of editing documents in Word, Excel and Powerpoint. Add a few (often freely) downloadable programs from the Internet, and it becomes a full multimedia powerhouse. The screen is just the right size for most of the thousands of games available, and there are several instant messaging solutions available to keep you connected to your friends on Yahoo!, MSN, AIM, Jabber, you name it.</p>, <p>There aren’t many things wrong with the Treo, and most of them are related to the product getting fairly long in the tooth. While the camera takes pretty good photos for the web, it’s still sub-megapixel, and has no flash. Most new high-end smartphones are coming with integrated WiFi. Even with an SDIO card, it’s not an option with Treo. That’s probably a good thing, because even without the high-powered radio inherent in WiFi, you’ll be charging the battery at least once a day, if not more. We’d recommend a USB charging/sync cable, so you can take advantage of those unoccupied USB ports to give your Treo some quick juice.</p>, <p>This year, the desktop is dead in the dorm room. With the rise of ultra-light notebooks and convertible laptops that actually pack some power there’s almost no reason to have a hefty computer humming away under a desk.</p>, <p><img/>, ($1,624, shown) a super-thin laptop with a 12.1-inch display. The only problem: it doesn’t have an optical drive, but then again, with the ever increasing functionality of web-based information, CDs and DVDs are quickly becoming optional.</p>, <p>If you’re in the market for high performance, try any one of the hot (not burn “hot”) new Intel Core 2 Duo laptops from<a href=""http://www.alienware.com/intro_pages/products/aw_nbcore2.aspx?source=1925"">Alienware’s</a>. They’re a bit pricey, but they’re completely customizable and they’re superiorly fast.</p>, <p><img class=""left"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/x100.jpg""/>If you simply must have a stationary computer, however, consider something like the <a href=""http://crunchgear.com/2006/08/14/shuttle-launches-x100/"">Shuttle XPC X100</a> (shown here). This tiny PC is about as big as a cereal box and has every audio and video output imaginable. Add an optical drive and build a mini media center that doubles as a homework station. A second runner-up is the <a href=""http://crunchgear.com/2006/08/21/shuttle-xpc-sd37p2-fastest-small-form-factor-pc/"">Shuttle XPC SD37P2</a>, one of the fastest, smallest PCs out there.</p>, <p>After a grueling three months of working at the local car wash and dealing with your parents’ ridiculous nagging, it’s time to go Back to School! With all that car wash money burning a hole in you’re pocket, you’re no doubt read to treat yourself to an HDTV. But there are loads of options out there and if you find yourself at the impasse of LCD, CRT and Plasma, we can help. First things first though: if you’re living in a dorm, you should check to see if you can get HD–I know many dorms still aren’t HD-friendly.</p>, <p>&lt;img src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/her that no bed is a small price to pay for HDTV.</p>, <p><img/> is a bit more expensive at $1,169, but it weighs a whole lot less than the CRT and takes up a lot less of your space. With a 4000:1 contrast ratio and 8ms response time, this LCD shouldn’t have too much problems displaying black colors, something LCDs traditionally don’t do so well on. The Samsung’s also got loads of inputs in its petite trunk: 2 composites, 2 S-Video, 1 component, 2HDMI, 2 RF, 1 USB and 1 RS232. Also, there’s two 10 watt stereo speakers and SRS TruSound XT virtual surround sound.</p>, <p><img/>, which goes for a public-school-tuition price of $3,272. It’s not only big, it has 1080p input support, which makes it perfect for the Blu-ray and HD DVD players you’ve no doubt already pre-ordered as well. Five composite inputs, two S-Video, three HDMI, one RF and one optical out makes this more pluggable than Evangeline Lilly from Lost. All your less financially well off roommates will thank you for it.</p>, <p><img class=""center"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/PYT-BLK-stuffed3800.jpg""/><br/>
Finally, no student is complete without the assistance of a good bag. Given the quantity of gear we carry around, we here at CrunchGear have become something of bag aficionados. Top out our recommendations is the <a href=""http://www.booqbags.com/Detail.bok?no=456"">Python XM </a>from Booq. This rugged daysack carries a 15″ laptop and conserves enough room for all of your other gear. You can easily fit all of your books and accessories without the bag becoming too bulky.</p>, <p>Those of you with photo gear should consider the <a href=""http://crunchgear.com/2006/08/28/naneu-pro-u120-battle-approved/"">Naneu Pro u120</a>. In addition to being able to tote a 15″ laptop, it includes a removable photo pack that can store an SLR camera and several lenses. This bag is as rugged as they come and completely capable of carrying your precious gadgets through battle to safety.</p>, <p>So there you have it, kids. As always, we encourage you to do your own research to decide precisely what gear is best for you. But using our guide as a basis for your research, you should be good to go. Good luck and don’t forget to study regularly, I know you kiddies can get distracted with your sock hops.</p>]"
Wii Madden '07 Video Surfaces,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""center"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/maddenwii.jpg""/></p>, <p>I don’t know about you, but I’ve been excited about playing Madden 2007 (and all the other sports games) on the Wii since I first saw the controller. So, when I saw <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi03Fm9u8J4"">this video</a> on YouTube, I kinda came close to wetting myself (alright that’s not funny, I have an incontinence problem. Yes I’m on medication. Just drop it OK?). I’ve heard a lot of rumblings about what gameplay would actually be like with the Wii games, and I wasn’t sure if we would actually be throwing a ball or tackling a player via the Wiimote. Turns out, we will.</p>, <p>I think the best feature shown off in this video is the Tutorial, where you actually perform the movement and the game tells you if you did it right or not. I really hope this is standard for most of the Wii game.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.i4u.com/article6434.html"">A New Wii Video: Walkthrough of Madden Wii</a> [I4U News via Joystiq]</p>]"
Two New BenQ Cameras Hit the Streets,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img align=""left"" class=""left""/>. Both cameras have advanced digicam features like automatic exposure control and shake-correction. They can also output in 16:9 mode, which is cool in that “well, OK” kind of way.</p>, <p>Throw in 3X optical zooms and 2.5-inch LCDs and the cameras start to look pretty enticing. The ISO 1000 mode will be sufficient enough for those photos you take in the bushes outside of her house will actually turn out, but it could stand to be higher. The Pentax lenses should make the photos look pretty clear, too. The C540 has a 5MP sensor, and the C740 has a 7MP. Other than that, they appear to be identical, specs-wise.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.letsgodigital.org/en/9921/benq_dcc540/"" target=""_blank"">BenQ DC C540</a> [LetsGoDigital]</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.letsgodigital.org/en/9922/benq_dcc740/"" target=""_blank"">BenQ DC C740</a> [LetsGoDigital]</p>]"

Microsoft's Treadwell and Bryant: Mesh and Office on Azure,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://qik.com/swfs/qik_player.swf?streamname=63fbce42ead343288d04f6bc07d59d51&amp;vid=470493&amp;playback=false&amp;polling=false&amp;user=SteveGillmor&amp;displayname=SteveGillmor&amp;safelink=SteveGillmor&amp;userlock=true&amp;islive=&amp;username=anonymous"">http://qik.com/swfs/qik_player.swf?streamname=63fbce42ead343288d04f6bc07d59d51&amp;vid=470493&amp;playback=false&amp;polling=false&amp;user=SteveGillmor&amp;displayname=SteveGillmor&amp;safelink=SteveGillmor&amp;userlock=true&amp;islive=&amp;username=anonymous</a></p>, <p>David Treadwell moves up the stack as Microsoft releases Live Framework to the developer community. With Mesh now clear as a fundamental glue and signaling layer within Azure services, Treadwell, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s Live Platform Services, tells TechCrunchIT that though Microsoft is focusing on developers at its Professional Developers event, the next big phase is to integrate the next version of Windows Live with Mesh infrastructure.</p>, <p>This is a classic old guard meets new guard moment, where Microsoft officials try and compartmentalize a massive disruptive wave along traditional group lines. As we hear from Office Enterprise’s Chris Bryant in another PDC video, the company is readying a technology preview of lightweight Office online applications.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.kyte.tv/flash.swf?v=2&amp;uri=channels/87522&amp;embedId=49354514"">http://www.kyte.tv/flash.swf?v=2&amp;uri=channels/87522&amp;embedId=49354514</a><a href=""http://media01.kyte.tv/images/updatenotice.swf"">http://media01.kyte.tv/images/updatenotice.swf</a> Watch as Bryant tiptoes through the minefield between the old Office jargon and the new talking points of the Azure direction: “We’re recognizing the company strategy of basically enabling connected productivity across the PC, the phone, and the browser. In order for customers to participate with each other in connected productivity scenarios, we have to reach out to the endpoints that they use on a regular basis.”</p>, <p>It’s the classic What Customers Are Asking Us For mantra. “We don’t look at it as feature parity between the Web applications and the desktop applications, because the scenarios that people will use the Web for are different scenarios. It isn’t about taking the entire feature set of Word and putting them on the Web.” The tension barely beneath the surface is between providing advanced features of Office on demand and the impact on Office’s revenue stream of a cannibalized Silverlight version.</p>, <p>Both officials say it’s very early, with Treadwell describing Mesh and Office integration as being in an experimental phase. But with the Office invite only preview coming later this year (it’s November, guys) and Mesh now opening up to third party developers through the Live Framework, reading between the lines has already started to be productive, especially if you’re on one of the one in four machines running Silverlight.</p>]"

New Live.com Services Shown at SearchChamps,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.live.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>I am visiting Microsoft HQ in Redmond this week for their <a href=""http://www.ebusiness-strategies.co.uk/news160106searchchamps.htm"">SearchChamps</a> event. Attendance requires the signing of an nondisclosure agreement, and most of what is discussed is non-bloggable. However, the trade off is that we see stuff that is still being developed in the labs (some of it isn’t even at the demo-stage yet).</p>, <p>A few of the services, however, are close to launch and are not covered by NDA. They include a new suite of Live.com services.</p>, <p>This one excites me the most. Live.com is a fully extensible ajax homepage (see <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/11/01/windows-live-more-than-an-ajax-desktop/"">my review here</a>) – there are a ton of third party “gadgets” that can be added to the site and are available at <a href=""http://microsoftgadgets.com/Gallery/"">microsoftgadgets.com</a>.</p>, <p>Google has a <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/12/14/googles-ajax-desktop-is-now-extensible/"">similarly extensible</a> home page.</p>, <p>However, unlike Microsoft, Google does not control the operating system for the large majority of worldwide personal computers. Sanaz Ahari, the program manager for Live.com, announced that <strong>Microsoft will allow gadgets to be dragged and dropped back and forth between live.com and the desktop (operating system). And they aren’t waiting for Vista – an update to Windows XP will be coming soon that will allow this drag and drop functionality.</strong></p>, <p>The result will be a <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/07/26/profile-konfabulatoryahoo-widgets/"">Yahoo-Widgets</a> like experience, and users will have the further ability to syncronize gadgets between the operating system and the live.com site.</p>, <p>Sanaz Ahari also showed some new Live.com/Media Center integration. Anyone using Windows Media Center to record television (I do) will also be able to remotely control their media center to add/remove/edit recordings from any computer, via their passport account and a live.com gadget. We saw a demo of this today and its going to be pretty cool.</p>, <p>Note that this is not an annoucement for “remote viewing”, although there are heavy rumors that this is the next step, and it seems pretty obvious.

Sun's Schwartz and his Failsafe moment,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a class=""shot2"" href=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/failsafe.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-672"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/failsafe.jpg"" title=""failsafe""/></a><br/>
Sun Microsystems is on the ropes. The New York Times <a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/sun-microsystems-a-lesson-in-failed-cosmetic-surgery/"">says so</a>, the hallway conversation starts and ends with “too bad”, and the wagons appear to be circling around, or rather, behind Jonathan Schwartz, leaving him outside the fort as the gates are closed.</p>, <p>Much of this capitulation to a situation Sun has been in for some time could come from the lessons of this long struggle in our country’s political and economic systems, which have become inextricably intertwined to the point where it apparently matters not at all what either candidate does or proposes. Instead, the public intuition is that change in management is less risky then standing pat.</p>, <p>With all this pressure on Schwartz, perhaps the best way to view the situation is to determine a so-called Failsafe deadline, so described as the point in time beyond which nuclear bombers can not turn back from their missions. In Sun’s case, what difference would a change in leadership make, and at what point?</p>, <p>The technology business is in the throes of a transformation to the so-called cloud computing paradigm. Despite what Oracle’s Ellison has said, Microsoft’s Windows Azure guarantees that at some point in time cloud computing will cross over and accumulate more than 50% of enterprise resource allocation. Calibrating that date will either confirm or undermine the strategies of the major platform vendors.</p>, <p>When Jonathan Schwartz took over the company, Sun was perceived as a major platform vendor with challenges in monetizing its resources. His strategy of marshalling the company’s assets and harnessing the viral nature of <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2008/10/30/never-mind-that-17-billion-loss-jonathan-schwartz-has-a-new-plan-to-save-sun/"">open source dynamics</a> has maintained Sun’s relationships with developers, but nowhere has there been the kind of disruptive messaging around the cloud computing paradigm that Schwartz employed to such good effect in marketing Sun in the Web 2.0 phase.</p>, <p>By contrast, even Apple jumped aggressively into the conversation with MobileMe; Google, Amazon, Rackspace, even Dell with a URL grab not only had a message but extended it with price cuts, acquisitions, and social media product announcements. Schwartz, who came to the job with a refreshing understanding of the power of blogging, Web services, and open source, projected confidence that these tools and communities could be intertwined with Sun’s leadership in disruptive hardware design and systems synergy.</p>, <p>The Schwartz version of a Jobsian reality distortion field went this way: If you understand the inevitability of small pieces loosely joined, you can build an interactive swarm-like community that will pool community resources to solve problems before other competitors even start to hear about them from top-down IT hierarchy. This must have been the rationale behind supporting community efforts such as Startup and other Camps. And it certainly was at the heart of the MySQL acquisition, which suggested the use of the open source database vendor as a sales channel through the entrepreneurial radar of the startup community and its open source DNA.</p>, <p>The media questioned where the rubber would meet the road, but as Google, Salesforce, and Facebook gathered incredible momentum and mindshare around Web architectures that spoke to the cool-running data center and virtualization innovations led by Sun, the fact that Sun wasn’t reaping concrete rewards didn’t mean they couldn’t over time.</p>, <p>That’s why Sun’s failure to keep the messaging ahead of the economic crisis is so damaging. Schwartz has always had the full support and partnership of his predecessor Scott McNealy, but the rumors that the board is looking for a replacement speak either to scapegoating or a capitulation to the realities of the marketplace. But why now?</p>, <p>Sun has the money to stay in business, and the portfolio to survive in the marketplace for some time to come. Why, then, is Schwartz’ scalp on the line? Perhaps it’s because, as we’ve seen in recent weeks in the McCain campaign, there’s a line forming to jump ship before the water reaches the band. Certainly the billion-plus loss just reported is enough cover, but more likely the lack of a cloud strategy that makes sense for Sun is at the root of the panic.</p>, <p>What then can Schwartz, or more accurately Sun do to change the dynamics of an increasingly dire situation. For starters, Schwartz has to do what few have done with the cloud computing discussion: answer the hard questions around security, compliance, and identity management with a disruptive view that speaks to Sun’s strengths. Sun has dogs in these hunts, and credibility with communities, particularly the beleaguered financial service which threaten Sun’s survival as they collapse and merge.</p>, <p>Schwartz can draw on a strength we’ve seen little of in recent months or perhaps years, the ability to assess where the marketplace and the conversation can go regardless of where the brass ring may end up. Part of the reason he ascended to the throne at Sun was as a Nixon going to China. Where McNealy baked antipathy for Microsoft into his personal and therefore corporate brand, Schwartz could manage rapprochement via CTO Greg Papadopoulos.</p>, <p>Now Schwartz needs to handicap the cloud wars and decide who the winners will be short, medium, and long term. He’s working with Amazon Web Services, but then so is Microsoft. Google and Apple seem unwilling to forge strategic alliances as App Engine builds out and MobileMe stabilizes without a corporate instantiation. That leaves Microsoft as the wild card with either the most or no chance of exploring mutual interests.</p>, <p>Strange bedfellows, indeed, but what other rabbit does Schwartz have up his sleeve? Either Oracle or IBM would be glad to pick over Sun’s bones and lift Java out of the remains. If Jonathan sits down and ponders Windows Azure, Mesh, and Live Services, does he see the enemy or the emergence of an open cross-platform RIA uber OS that could easily integrate Sun virtualization and middleware to leapfrog enterprise concerns about cloud computing now, as opposed to several years from now when these problems will have been solved through a combination of standards and political restructuring of requirements in the new Washington.</p>, <p>It’s a heady leap, but who better than Schwartz to paint a disruptive picture in a way that takes the pressure off the short term and gives Sun breathing room while other companies have the opportunity to screw up equally well. Schwartz has the opportunity and the bank roll to sell the enterprise on cloud computing across an open landscape not bound by the old political calculations but rather a nonpartisan approach that seems to be driving Obama into the White House.

Firefox 2 Available for Developers (And You),"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""right"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/firefox-logo.jpg""/></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.desktoplinux.com"">Desktoplinux.com</a> went ahead and downloaded Mozilla’s Firefox 2 Beta 2 edition and were kind enough to do a rundown of the new features.  Right now, it’s only available from Mozilla’s FTP site, <a href=""ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/2.0b2/"">here</a>.  It’s only supposed to be used by developers, but if you really just NEEEEED it now, here’s a rundown of the new features, as listed by the Firefox team:<span id=""more-677""></span></p>, <p>    * Visual refresh — Firefox 2’s theme and user interface have been updated to improve usability without altering the familiarity of the browsing experience. For instance, toolbar buttons now glow when you hover over them.</p>, <p>    * Built-in phishing protection — Phishing Protection warns users when they encounter suspected Web forgeries, and offers to return the user to their home page. Phishing Protection is turned on by default, and works by checking sites against either a local or online list of known phishing sites. This list is automatically downloaded and regularly updated when the Phishing Protection feature is enabled.</p>, <p>    * Enhanced search capabilities — Search term suggestions will now appear as users type in the integrated search box when using the Google, Yahoo! or Answers.com search engines. A new search engine manager makes it easier to add, remove and re-order search engines, and users will be alerted when Firefox encounters a website that offers new search engines that the user may wish to install.</p>, <p>    * Improved tabbed browsing — By default, Firefox will open links in new tabs instead of new windows, and each tab will now have a close tab button. Power users who open more tabs than can fit in a single window will see arrows on the left and right side of the tab strip that let them scroll back and forth between their tabs. The History menu will keep a list of recently closed tabs, and a shortcut lets users quickly re-open an accidentally closed tab.</p>, <p>    * Resuming your browsing session — The Session Restore feature restores windows, tabs, text typed in forms, and in-progress downloads from the last user session. It will be activated automatically when installing an application update or extension, and users will be asked if they want to resume their previous session after a system crash.</p>, <p>    * Previewing and subscribing to Web feeds — Users can decide how to handle Web feeds (like this one), either subscribing to them via a Web service or in a standalone RSS reader, or adding them as Live Bookmarks. My Yahoo!, Bloglines and Google Reader come pre-loaded as Web service options, but users can add any Web service that handles RSS feeds.</p>, <p>    * Inline spell checking — A new built-in spell checker enables users to quickly check the spelling of text entered into Web forms.</p>, <p>    * Live Titles — When a website offers a microsummary (a regularly updated summary of the most important information on a Web page), users can create a bookmark with a “Live Title.” Compact enough to fit in the space available to a bookmark label, they provide more useful information about pages than static page titles, and are regularly updated with the latest information. There are several websites that can be bookmarked with Live Titles, and even more add-ons to generate Live Titles for other popular websites.</p>, <p>    * Improved Add-ons manager — The new Add-ons manager improves the user interface for managing extensions and themes, combining them both in a single tool.</p>, <p>    * New Windows installer: Based on Nullsoft Scriptable Install System, the new Windows installer resolves many long-standing issues.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS3852026030.html"">Firefox 2.0 beta 2 boasts enhanced look, features</a> [Desktoplinux.com]</p>]"

Well, for a flash-based MP3 player it’s kind of bulky. Three times the thickness of an iPod Nano actually.</p>, <p>The UI itself is very attractive. On the 1.7-inch OLED screen, an equalizer, scroll buttons, and playback control.

The Battle for Microsoft's Soul,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a class=""shot2"" href=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/politburo.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-688"" height=""243"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/politburo.jpg"" title=""politburo"" width=""297""/></a><br/>
So much of this long protracted struggle for political change has rubbed off on the tech community. In the partisan windup to this long election process, we’ve become almost inured to the fact that as much as things will continue to be the same, already the “choice” between the two candidates has produced one sure thing. That is, either of the two candidates represents fundamental change from the status quo, no matter how much you want to differentiate further.</p>, <p>So it is with the shift to the Cloud. Whether you’re betting on Google, or Amazon, or Microsoft, or less obviously Apple, IBM, Oracle, or Cisco, the sure thing is that Web services has gone main stream. If this is a horse race at the vendor level, it’s about each company’s ability to harness its innate strengths and migrate its weaknesses. Put another way, the battle is within, not between.</p>, <p>So it is with Microsoft, mere months into Bill Gates’ retirement. Though <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/otl/?authorId=9877562"">my friend Dan Farber</a> and others raise the specter of Gates returning to lead Microsoft at some climactic point, more likely Gates has already weighed in and signed off on the strategy unveiled at the PDC in Los Angeles this past week. <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2008/10/28/ballmer-email-microsoft-is-really-sticking-to-software-plus-services-message/"">Steve Ballmer’s leaked memo</a> could easily have been written by Ray Ozzie, with its methodical restating of the software plus services case and the surprising (for Ballmer) summoning of Live Mesh at the end as Azure’s secret sauce:</p>, <p>Live Mesh hints at how our lives will be transformed as the barriers between devices disappear and the option to connect instantly to people, devices, programs, and information becomes a reality.</p>, <p>Who is Ballmer speaking to? Ostensibly customers, the target of subscribers to Executive Emails from Microsoft. But really the refactored executive team inside the company, and in no uncertain terms, the power structure built largely by Gates and managed by Ballmer. To a Steven Sinofsky, “the barriers between devices” speaks differently than to a Bob Muglia, David Thompson, Scott Guthrie, or David Treadwell. That’s because Sinofsky owns only one leg of that PC-Web-Phone stool that the Azure Services Platform rests on.</p>, <p>The second day keynote also hinted at the new political alignment in the company. While the first day introduced the cloud strategy, the <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/ozzie/10-27PDC08daytwo.mspx"">second</a> spoke as much to the Palace Guard as it did to the developers. Sinofsky’s Windows 7 brought the first significant developer applause of the week, perhaps a reflection of the sense that the OS would indeed survive the OS/X challenge with its Touch feature set, multi-monitor support, and screen management tools. As a Mac user, I had the odd sensation of feeling like Microsoft was trying to reengage with switchers, a point Ray Ozzie joked about in a later conversation.</p>, <p>But to the Microsoft rank and file, another message was clear. Sinofsky stayed completely away from the rest of the Azure announcements, hewing closely to the fundamental keep-the-trains-running-on-time reassurance that Vista (and by implication Longhorn) were mistakes of the previous regime. But wait, that was Bill’s regime, and Sinofsky is partially running against himself this time out. His former job as Office boss is now owned by Stephen Elop, who did not speak, instead handing that task to junior executives for the Office Online demo.</p>, <p>By contrast, Bob Muglia, who controls the Server group with its burgeoning revenue gusher, straddles both old and new Microsoft. A wily tactician who survived the DOJ meltdown where others didn’t, seems poised to inherit the mantle of Allchin in the new reworked Redmond. To him, the 3-legged stool is all upside “and the option to connect instantly to people, devices, programs, and information becomes” not only “a reality” but an annuity.</p>, <p>Scott Guthrie continued the subtle shift from old to new, highlighting  Windows 7 features such as jump lists exposed to developers via Windows Presentation Foundation, a new WPF Toolkit with support for the same Visual State Manager and controls shipped two weeks earlier for Silverlight. .The &lt;net 4 Framework was also previewed, including multi-touch features and the deep zoom technology also shipping with Silverlight. In other words, Silverlight is the first place we're seeing key technologies of the new Azure stack.</p>, <p>Silverlight gives .Net developers real skin in the cloud game without undermining the open nature of Mesh and Azure's REST and RSS/Atom gateways. Ozzie's challenge is not to convince developers of the power of the Cloud, but to leverage Microsoft's legacy cash cows without letting the people who own those groups stifle innovation as they have done for years. The loudest applause line of the two major keynotes was for the BBC's Anthony Rose and his BBC iPlayer demo, where Silverlight and Live Mesh Services harnessed social graph and user behavior that went several steps beyond anything from competitors including Google, Facebook, or Apple.</p>, <p>Now, what’s really interesting here is because this is Mesh-ified, this information is going off to all my devices. So, if I’m in the office and I’ve watched a program halfway through, and I’m now going out for lunch, I can take out my cell phone, and when I go on my cell phone, that program has been synched to the cell phone. And it’s not just the information, the metadata, but through the cloud the actual program is on the phone and the program, in fact, will resume playing from exactly where I left off on my desktop computer.</p>, <p>The PDC developers could smell money, and this was with live code orchestrated by a customer. This makes the questions about pricing and timing moot: Microsoft has the money to get this out there, and the timing is real soon now for a tech community looking to rebound from the tough times ahead. But the developers, though comforted by the Windows 7 snapshot and mildly enthusiastic about the online Office pitch, were voting with their applause for the Silverlight/Mesh/Azure triumvirate as the way forward.</p>, <p>Office for the Web may pan out as just a leg of the stool for collaborative purposes, but the Silverlight Office has never seemed more disruptive. Significantly, no Outlook Web version was shown, suggesting that Ozzie is keeping his powder dry while giving Mesh time to ripen along with its PubSub router underpinnings. Again, from Anthony Rose:</p>, <p>[MSN] Messenger is the largest IM network in the UK. So, for the BBC this is a huge viral opportunity. Imagine all of my friends just a click away, I can share my iPlayer programs and activity feed with them.</p>, <p>We’re looking at the next Outlook, and it’s going to be hard to stop inside Microsoft’s executive war room. The biggest single sound we heard at the Azure rollout was that of silence – a three year incubation period where very little of what Ray Ozzie has been building leaked out, and that which did was couched in terms that gave the old guard little to attack or slow down. Now that it’s here and endorsed by Ballmer in such unequivocal terms, the war for Microsoft’s soul is over. By opening the platform to <a href=""http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/10/31/uri-xml-http-rest-and-the-azure-services-platform/"">standards</a> forged in large part by scripters, hackers, and especially competitors, Microsoft has leapfrogged into the lead for mindshare where it counts: inside the company.</p>]"

The Online Storage Gang,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/onlinestoragelogos.jpg""/></p>, <p>The online storage market is evolving fast. In the past, users could expect no more than a simple service where files could be slowly uploaded and downloaded from a mapped virtual drive or a simple web based interface. Little competition (and the bursting of the bubble) led to very high prices for a minimal amount of storage.</p>, <p>Over the last year a slew of new services have launched (some are launching in February) with serious web 2.0 features, reasonable pricing (including free unlimited storage) and, in at least one case (<a href=""http://www.omnidrive.com"">OmniDrive</a>), the ability to read/write directly to the file with local applications like Office, on the remote server. This last feature speeds the process of writing to files significantly by skipping the requirement to download the file to the hard drive first.</p>, <p><big><strong>The Online Storage Gang</strong></big><br/>
We looked at a total of thirteen companies. They are: <a href=""http://www.allmydata.com"">AllMyData</a>, <a href=""http://www.box.net"">Box.net</a>, <a href=""http://www.esnips.com"">eSnips</a>, <a href=""https://freepository.com"">Freepository</a>, (the unfortunately named) <a href=""https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/email/vsdb_landing.asp?se=%2B&amp;app%5Fhdr=&amp;ci=2661"">GoDaddy</a>, <a href=""http://www.iomega.com/na/products/istorage.jsp"">iStorage</a>, <a href=""http://www.mofile.com/en/"">Mofile</a>, <a href=""http://www.mozy.com/"">Mozy</a>, <a href=""http://www.omnidrive.com"">Omnidrive</a>, <a href=""http://www.openomy.com"">Openomy</a>, <a href=""http://www.streamload.com"">Streamload</a>, <a href=""http://www.strongspace.com/"">Strongspace</a> and <a href=""http://www.xdrive.com"">Xdrive</a>.</p>, <p>Another service, <a href=""http://www.zingee.com"">Zingee</a>, has yet to launch and may also (or may not) have a compelling offering.</p>, <p>Of the thirteen companies that we researched for this post, three really stand out. <strong><a href=""http://www.omnidrive.com"">Australia-based OmniDrive</a> (unfunded but not for long) is the clear leader in features</strong>. Box.net and Streamload are also very good choices.</p>, <p>The services can roughly be broken down into storage-centric and sharing-centric. Some services, like Mozy and the unfortunately named Godaddy, are centered on storage only. GoDaddy offers online file backup with very basic uploading and downloading features – effectively a remote network drive. They are a bare-bones service with a fairly attractive price point ($20/year for 2 GB). You will not find sharing or other advanced features here.</p>, <p>Other services offer storage but really focus on sharing files. There are a number of options here, but the best (OmniDrive, Box.net and Streamload) offer full private and public sharing. In addition, I really like the way Box.net approaches group folders, where any number of people can have read/write priviliges. Omnidrive is close to launching this feature as well.</p>, <p><big><strong>Web 2.0 Features</strong></big><br/>
Most of the new players (possibly with the exception of Mozy) are laser focused on key web 2.0 features. The best have multiple folders (private, shared, group, public), RSS feeds for each folder, etc. A couple, including Omnidrive, have also built features that allow subscriptions for RSS enclosures (such as podcasts), so that those files are stored in the cloud instead of your hard drive.</p>, <p>And OmniDrive has one key feature that no one else matches: full read/write functionality on the file, in the cloud. Open a file from your Omnidrive, edit it and write it back to Omnidrive without ever downloading a local copy. Once they release their API, I imagine many, many services will mash the Omnidrive storage service into their applications. It is just too compelling not to.</p>, <p>AllMyData, unique among the group, is a full peer-to-peer solution with “grid storage”. This means you give up storage on your hard drive for other users, and you get theirs in return. Putting aside the fact that giving up storage is exactly what users don’t want when looking for a solution, the fact that others’ computers must be powerd up and online for you to be able to access your files is a serious service limitation.</p>, <p><big><strong>Pricing</strong></big><br/>
Pricing is all over the place, although I expect it to settle down as competition drives some of these companies out of the market.</p>, <p>Streamload is the most aggresive on pricing – offering a full 25 GB free to every user.</p>, <p>The obvious way to market these products, in my opinion, is to boldly offer unlimited storage for a nominal sum. Costs can be covered via a one-time sign up fee and through charges on download bandwidth (once I need the files, I’m willing to pay to get them).</p>, <p>I firmly believe that online storage should, and will, be packaged with new computers and applications like Windows. The amount of unprotected but hugely important media content out there on hard drives (music, movies, home movies, pictures), is growing every day. People need somewhere to back this data up for a reasonable fee, and it seems to me that Dell and others should package this service with the PC. All initial software would be auto stored, and users would have the option to continuously syncronize their hard drive with the virtual drive.</p>, <p>And while this business has thin margins, this is a multi-billion dollar per year revenue opportunity.</p>, <p><big><strong>The Chart</strong></big><br/>

Realtime goes primetime,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">Friendfeed’s march toward realtime functionality is already seeing some switching from focus on Identi.ca as the service most likely to dent Twitter’s rule of the micromessagesphere. One star developer, <a href=""http://friendfeed.com/dlsspy"">Dustin Sallings</a> is now moving forward with a new XMPP service even as Gnip announces it’s <a href=""http://blog.gnipcentral.com/2008/11/03/winding-down-xmpp-for-now/"">abandoning</a> XMPP services because of problems with servers consuming its often promised but never arriving firehose feed of Twitter public messages.</p>, <p>Sallings and his co-developer <a href=""http://friendfeed.com/kshep"">Ken Sheppardson</a> appear to have tired of waiting for Twitter to provide access that would allow third parties to deliver realtime track services instead of the 15-minute delayed TwitterSpy which sucks indirectly off the Summize Twitter search output. Twitter recently took IM off their fix list, and Gnip reported no response to requests from multiple developers for XMPP permission.</p>, <p>Now Sallings and Sheppardson are reaching into Friendfeed’s realtime feed and providing Jabber (XMPP) access to and from individual comments. A two-letter naming convention lets you reply directly to comments of those you subscribe to in Friendfeed from your Gtalk or Gchat window. One immediate benefit: Gmail archives the chats, eliminating the 100 message limit Friendfeed currently employs on realtime feeds.</p>, <p>Sallings already provides track services for Identi.ca and other instances of its parent Laconica project. There a re several paths to adding track to enjit, either by constraining the search cloud to those who join the <a href=""http://www.enjit.com"">enjit</a> service, or by getting Friendfeed to provide wider access to the firehose. While Friendfeed has not specifically confirmed the timing of its own XMPP output, they have certainly indicated they are working on it. But more importantly, Friendfeed seems interested in carefully building out its feature set via APIs rather than walling the whole container off via business decisions.</p>, <p>Yesterday’s  Salesforce partnering with Facebook, along with a similar two-step with Amazon Web Services, indicates the speed with which not only startups and skunkwork projects can achieve velocity but major players as well. At the post-keynote Q &amp; A with Marc Benioff, the Salesforce CEO beat back talk of adding Microsoft Azure to the list of services that can hook directly into the Force.com development model. But eventually Benioff had to concur that it will be up to developers to decide what components, gadgets, runtimes, and Web services will be aggregated.</p>, <p>A direct reply mechanism of the type demonstrated by enjit levels the playing field for Friendfeed, making it compatible with Twitter functionality while taking advantage of Friendfeed’s ability to aggregate other messaging services and orchestrating them. Last week saw a new <a href=""https://friendfeed.com/account/"">Friendfeed feature</a> that lets users bridge comments out to Twitter, moving a big step forward to putting Friendfeed in the dominant position at the head of the chain, making Twitter a client of Friendfeed and encouraging production of a bridge to other services such as Identi.ca to round out the tail of the micromessaging channel.</p>, <p>enjit’s two-letter reply scheme can certainly be extended to encode not just the message but the originating service. This is the holy grail, where smart clients can handle cross-platform handoffs and manage name collisions and the intricacies of direct messaging. And with Microsoft Live Mesh entering beta, its significant resources and Silverlight integration suggest rich clients that at a minimum make possible offline synchronization and multimedia consoles much like the BBC application shown at the PDC.</p>, <p>What’s truly disruptive is the degree to which developers can wire together these realtime apps across platforms, from Google with its gadget lab tool that allows injecting services into the Gmail console to Facebook’s social graph to Friendfeed’s aggregation router to Mesh’s device caching and multimedia rendering engine. Twitter may be paying the price for ignoring the free range developers who will endow this componentized architecture with credibility and IT investment.</p>]"

I want my iTV,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""shot2"" src=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/tv_remote.jpg""/></p>, <p>At the O’Reilly Web 2.0 Summit conference in San Francisco, a context switch from Web 2.0 to cloud computing is well under way. Wired’s Kevin Kelly suggested a variation of the Semantic Web where pages give way to the data on the pages, with each of those chunks representing real objects in physical space, or a Kelly said, anything that can hold an electric charge.</p>, <p>AT&amp;T’s Ralph de la Vega told Mike Arrington that he foresaw a world where phones controlled TVs, coffee machines, cars, and every other device along the way to and from work. The notion of a universal remote or mouse as Microsoft Research defined it years ago is now becoming an economic reality, one that de la Vega suggests is recession-immune as of now. The presence of a keyboard, whether physical as per the Blackberry Bold or virtual on the iPhone, is the new dividing line, with AT&amp;T deriving north of $95 a month revenue versus $58 per month for the average user.</p>, <p>de la Vega responded to an audience question by confirming AT&amp;T will “shortly” release software to allow iPhone tethering to PCs. A German blog also reported an iPhone 2.2 software update will allow direct downloading of podcasts, bypassing iTunes and essentially kickstarting a streaming model for advertiser-supported media on the go. The new service reportedly is limited to 10MB per file, which provides additional ad inventory for longer shows.</p>, <p>de la Vega said AT&amp;T 3G actually supports up to 3.6 megabits service, but today the maximimum available is 700K for phones up to 1.7mbs for laptops. With today’s Wayport acquisition, which adds 20,000 wifi hotspots available to iPhone and other AT&amp;T-supported devices, and AT&amp;T’s U-Verse IPTV service, which bundles wireless access and a screen to screen DVR capability in the home, AT&amp;T is close to establishing an alternate media service that may well supplant cable and even broadcast media control.</p>, <p>As we’re seeing with iterative granularized API access to micromessaging services, the on-demand information services that users can cobble together continue to outperform last-gen models among early adopters. As de la Vega suggests, simplicity and ease of use will soon overwhem bandwidth, carrier, and device restrictions as the key driver of mobile disruption. The old song is becoming: I want my iTV.</p>]"
Attensa Rolls Out of Beta,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.attensa.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a><a href=""http://www.attensa.com"">Attensa</a> (previous <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/tag/Attensa/"">profiles here</a>) is announcing a bunch of product upgrades and releases tomorrow. The most important are the removal of the beta status from their Outlook and Online RSS readers. Both products are at 1.0 status as of tomorrow morning.</p>, <p>Both readers have fairly advanced features. Attensa Online 1.0, which is Ajax driven, has been <a href=""http://www.feedblog.org/2005/12/attensa_public_.html"">criticized</a> during its beta period for not having enough features. Many of those features are now included, and some, like tagging, are on the way. And both readers are fast, at least under current loads. One feature that I like on both products is the ability to review posts on a folder/feed basis, or “river of news” where posts are shown in a more traditional email format as they come in.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>The big win with RSS readers, though, is in synchronization across applications. There are two aspects to this – synchronization of the feed (OPML) list, and synchronization of the status (read/unread/tagged/pinned) of individual posts. Both are important, although the difficult problem is synchronizing posts. Attensa is doing both.</p>, <p>NewsGator does attempt to synchronize posts from both its FeedDemon desktop product and its Outlook product to its online product, but you cannot directly syncronize between FeedDemon and Newsgator. Also, synchronization often breaks.</p>, <p>Attensa claims their architecture is robust enough to handle the difficult sync problem. Further testing will show if this is accurate. Note that the Attensa readers are all free; however the synchronization feature is $20 per year after a 30 day free trial.</p>, <p>Attensa also has a third reader, for mobile devices, coming within “four weeks”.</p>]"

Canon EOS 40D Info Leaked,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""center"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/060905_1.jpg""/><br/>
Canon is <i>allegedly</i> upgrading the EOS series to 40D on September 26th. The new camera will <i>potentially</i> have a 10.1-megapixel sensor, a 2.5-inch LCD and  that anti-dust feature. Not much else right now, but we can assume the 30D will go down about $100 – <a href=""http://crunchgear.com/2006/08/24/canon-launches-long-awaited-rebel-xt-follow-up-rebel-xti/"">just like with the Rebel XT</a> – and this one will be priced at <a href=""http://www.dpreview.com/news/0602/06022114canoneos30d.asp"">30D levels</a>, about $1,300. The image, BTW, is a mock-up.</p>, <p>UPDATE – Canon doesn’t like us tell you not to shop. Here’s the news straight from the horses’ mouth:</p>, <p>  Please know that this camera is not scheduled for a release anytime soon that we know of, or if it even being developed at this time. The EOS 30D is still current, and will remain so for a while. I am sorry to say that your writer may have been misinformed.<br/>
         While we are no strangers to internet rumors,  We ask you to please remove your posting on this camera, because it instructs consumers to not buy the EOS 30D, which we feel is not a good business practice.

Ning's New Stuff,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.ning.com""></a><a href=""http://www.ning.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>I wrote a <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/01/20/ning-rip/"">very critical post</a> about <a href=""http://www.ning.com"">Ning</a> two weeks ago that generated a lot of <a href=""http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/003321.html"">discussion</a> (Rob Hof at Business Week <a href=""http://blogs.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2006/01/whats_wrong_wit.html"">followed</a> my story, then <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2006/01/mea_culpa_wrong.html"">retracted</a>).</p>, <p>The main thing that I took away from the discussion was that Ning employees responded professionally to my admittedly inflamatory post title (Ning – R.I.P.). And they <a href=""http://blog.ning.com/2006/01/some_of_whats_been_happening_a_1.html""> subsequently reached out </a>to both me and the Ning community in general to better communicate their product plans. Ning had been a impenetrable fortress to me prior to that post – I just could not make contact with anyone senior (not that they owe that to me). However, after visiting CEO Gina Bianchini at the Ning offices in Palo Alto last week, I now have a much better idea of where the company is going in the near future. And I am going to post some of the details here.</p>, <p>First of all, Ning already has some dedicated people creating and promoting applications. I saw a number of examples of existing applications, like <a href=""http://cinecrap.ning.com/"">cinecrap</a>, that are at least defendable as “interesting”, particularly given the early stage of Ning’s product.</p>, <p>Second, Ning is working hard to roll out new features, including dead-simple tools  to create uniquely different applications without the need for any programming skills whatsoever.</p>, <p>Currenlty, to do much other than clone an existing application, you need to know PHP or at least HTML. What I saw last week, which was not yet release-ready, was already good enough to make Ning a very useful platform. Basically, they’ve combined an AJAX drag and drop interface with simple web forms to position and interact with modules. A “module” can either be Ning created, or more interestingly, a third party web service such as Google Maps or Amazon book meta data. If I had seen this stuff before, I would not have written my previous post.</p>, <p>There are other great features coming as well, such as a premium hosting plan that allows publishers to put in their own ads, host applications themselves, etc.</p>, <p>The core strengths of Ning are the new tools to build applications without programming skills, and the shared customer base which allows an new application creator to have instant access to all registered Ning customers (you register once at Ning as a user, and can then use all applications).</p>, <p>As many people said in the comments to my previous post, the market will decide if Ning is successful. But they are most definitely not dead.</p>]"

Each song also links to a summary of the band and song. Finally, whenever you visit another user’s favorites page, you can click and add any station that they have created. A station on Pandora is a highly customized feed of music based on the user’s preferences. Sharing stations just became a lot easier.</p>, <p>Pandora has also added a number of <a href=""http://www.pandora.com/feeds"">RSS feed</a> options.

Essentially, Phuser is going to become a mashup of other Web 2.0 services and applications, bringing it all into the one space and making it all trackable. When a new application comes along, Phuser will grab the API and integrate it into the service, and because it will sit in the middle it could also generate a potential income for its partners.

They are styling the new site as ‘Basecamp meets Facebook Apps’ but a more original feature of Phuser than some will be its use of SMS to update teams about new materials.</p>, <p>Obviously basing your entire business model on other people’s applications is not always the stablest of business models.

Solution for Sudden MacBook Shutdowns,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/>, take a look at this DIY solution. An engineer from Germany took his own MacBook apart and seems to have found the problem.</p>, <p>The cause? The heat sensor cable that sits next to the CPU’s heat sink. As the heat sink expands during use, the cable comes into contact with the sink and gets its insulation melted, thus shorting the cable and causing the MacBook to turn off. After a while, the heat sink cools, shrinks, and breaks the short, which means your MacBook is fine to turn back on.</p>, <p>A solution is to bust open your case and place some insulation tape around the affected areas of the sensor cable. Once you do that—unless the tape melts also—there should be no problems with sudden shutdowns. Though this procedure may or may not void your warranty. You may want to just wait until Apple acknowledges and fixes this for you.</p>, <p><a href=""http://maba.wordpress.com/2006/09/01/macbook-shutdown-solved-at-last-hopefully/"">Random Macbook Shutdowns.

Movoxx Launches Mobile Print Coupons,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.movoxx.com""><img class=""shot"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/movoxx_logo1.jpg"" style=""float:left;""/></a>Founders Alec Andronikov and Derek Merrill of <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/10/23/jingle-networks-has-now-raised-over-60-million/"">Free411</a> competitor <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/12/26/att-acquires-infreeda-gets-into-free-411-business/"">InFreeDA</a> have launched a new mobile coupon startup <a href=""http://movoxx.com"">MoVoxx</a> after selling off their free 411 service to AT&amp;T. The service lets you move print coupons on to your mobile phone by dialing into an 800 number listed with the print version, or subscribe to weekly SMS updates of coupons that interest you for free. Coupons are just text messages, so advertisers will have to be willing to have them spread through forwarding. Subscribers can also deactivate their account by SMS or MoVoxx.com.</p>, <p>MoVoxx quietly launched this Wednesday in San Francisco, where they are based, with the Guardian and San Jose Mercury news as partners. Both papers are running ads of the service in order to expand their advertising reach to an opt-in mobile audience. MoVoxx says that print coupons get about a 1% redemption rate. The opt in structure is sure to push that higher. We reported earlier that Cellfire has been seeing a <a href=""http://mobilecrunch.com/2006/06/27/cellfire-takes-coupon-app-national-tomorrow-but-the-real-story-is-usage/"">20% redemption rate</a> by making coupons mobile. The Guardian launch is geared toward coupons dealing with nightlife, while the San Jose launch is aimed at dining. MoVoxx hopes to keep the signal to noise ratio high by only sending updates of 2 or 3 three top coupons during the later half of the week, coinciding with the most social nights of the week.</p>, <p><img class=""shot2"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/movoxx_screen.jpg"" style=""float:right;""/>MoVoxx has an interesting take on mobile coupons by appealing to the least common denominator in mobile access, 800 numbers and text messaging.

Cellfire currently works with 9 advertisers. Movoxx, on the other hand, has the potential to quickly snatch up a wide range of advertisers (big and small) that already work with print publishers.

Word on the grapevine is that the iMac will stretch to 23-inches, as well as getting a Core Duo 2 upgrade. The Nano will likely gain capacity and relaunch in a rainbow of colors, as Apple likes to do.</p>, <p>Unknown is whether or not we’ll be getting an update to the current iPod with Video, from 30/60GB configurations to 40/80GB versions (possible), or if we’ll be seeing a brand-new, 6G iPod, the “true” Video iPod that’s been rumored for close to a year now. The former is likely as the iPod is almost a year along with no updates at all, and hard drive capacity has increased since it’s launch while prices have dropped. The latter is unlikely, as sources say the “true” Video iPod is still a few months off, as Apple is waiting to see what Big Redmond does with Zune. But Apple’s surprised us before, so we can’t say for certain what will happen with iPod.</p>, <p>The big news we should see is a brand new device that’s making the <a href=""http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=2016"" target=""_blank"">conjecture circles</a>: a stand-alone gadget for streaming video to televisions and home theater systems.

"Another Day, Another iPhone Rumor","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img align=""left"" class=""left""/>I’ve been trying not to answer my phone if it’s another iPhone rumor, but it keeps ringing. I feel like every analyst on the planet is drunk dialing me at the same time. Eventually, you have to pick it up and allow them to ramble.</p>, <p>This week is no different. The on-again-off-again rumors of Steve and company phoning home come from Shaw Wu, an analyst at American Technology Research. Wu (without citing sources) is convinced that Apple’s working on a candy-bar style phone, roughly the size of an iPod Nano, that will ship in three unknown colors. He’s guessing white, black, and metallic. He goes on to declare that the product has moved past the prototype stage and is ready for production.<br/>
<span id=""more-736""></span><br/>
The real question, which Wu doesn’t touch on, is Apple’s carrier strategy. A cellphone is nothing without a network to support it. And because America has two competing technologies, unlike the rest of the world, a plug-n-play option isn’t really feasible. This leaves Apple in the unenviable position of either partnering with a carrier (Cingular comes to mind), or starting up their own MVNO, most likely branded with iTunes. They could also go the Nokia route and sell the phone in Apple stores as an unlocked GSM device, allowing consumers to pop in a SIM card and have all sorts of fun.</p>, <p>Apple has always shied away from arrangements it can’t control, and will be looking for killer market share from the get-go, so the partnership route doesn’t look appealing. MVNOs, in contrast, tend to be money pits, with most unable to turn a profit. That just isn’t the Apple way. But this doesn’t mean this isn’t what Apple plans on doing, as I’d expect nothing less from the Jobsians than a third, unexpected option that would blow us away.</p>, <p>In a related, if disturbing note, there is really no FCC mention of this device, and wireless devices should be cleared by the FCC before they go to market.

"HubPages, a better Squidoo?","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.hubpages.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>Paul Edmondson, the founder of <a href=""http://www.hubpages.com/"">HubPages</a> in Berkeley, California, thinks Squidoo is onto a good idea, but needs improvement in a number of areas. And he’s in the process of building something he says will be significantly better, both for publishers and readers.</p>, <p>Squidoo has basic tools for publishers to create “lenses”, which are topic specific websites. For example, see <a href=""http://www.squidoo.com/introtoweb20/"">this site on Web 2.0</a> by Joshua Porter. The idea is to allow an expert to create a site, combining static/evergreen and refreshed content. Better sites bubble to the top and publishers have the ability to earn a share of advertising.</p>, <p>But Squidoo is stingy when it comes to sharing money with publishers. They split profits, not revenue. And they give 5% to charity before splitting profits.</p>, <p>We divide up the money we receive in a very public way. First, we pay our bills. That’s direct out of pocket expenses like rent and servers and salary and benefits expenses (our CEO doesn’t take a salary, and neither does our board of directors). Then, with no other deductions, we pay 5% of our post-expense revenue directly to the charity pool, 50% directly to our lensmasters and retain the rest to pay off investors and employees.</p>, <p>HubPages is taking a different approach. They are promising more tools to create and promote sites, as well as an aggressive 50/50 revenue split with publishers.</p>, <p>Hubpages purpose is to provide easy-to-use tools and traffic to help anyone to produce content and monetize their knowledge by creating webpages.  There will be monetization programs to choose from consisting of products, advertisements and lead generation tools that each person can easily incorporate into their pages.  Hubpages will split revenue with the content creator.  The pages are organized in the Hubpages website based on algorithmic quality index that promotes the best pages throughout the hierarchy (based on tags) of the website.  Each author will earn a reputation score called a HubScore that can be referenced to meter the quality of the content by an author.</p>, <p>Hubpages will be positioned to take advantage of the significant numbers of new web content providers that want to supplement their income through content like many people do on eBay by selling goods.</p>, <p>The Hubpages team is founded by three guys out of Microsoft that were part of the successful startup MongoMusic.  The team includes Paul Edmondson, Jay Reitz, and Paul Deeds.  Most recently, Paul Edmondson was the Group Product Manager for MSN Entertainment, Jay Reitz was the Development Manager, and Paul Deeds was a developer in Windows Media Internet Services.</p>, <p>Sign up for the HubPages beta at <a href=""http://www.hubpages.com"">Hubpages.com</a>.</p>]"

reLive: Automatically Map Your Mobile Photos,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://relive.atlasct.com""><img alt=""relivelogo.png"" class=""shot"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/relivelogo.png"" style=""float:left;""/></a>Today mapping veteran AtlasCT (est. 1987) is launching a new mobile photo geotagging application for Java ME called <a href=""http://relive.atlasct.com"">reLive!</a>. It seems similar to Yahoo!’s geotagging program for Flickr, <a href=""http://research.yahoo.com/zonetag/"">Zonetag</a>. However, reLive! is not meant to only geotag individual photos, but also connect them on the map in the context of a trip. When paired with a GPS system, reLive! lets you automatically map tagged photos, video, or virtual postcards you make along your trip. Since each photo is also time stamped, the photos, video, and postcards can also be ordered along the path of your trip. The whole trip can also be viewed and shared through an account on their website. Their current default example is of a meandering trip through Barcelona.</p>, <p>The program won the Social Networking award for Europe at the NAVTEQ Global LBS Challenge at 3GSM in Barcelona. The application was designed to show off AtlasCT’s vector based mapping program, which requires smaller data transfers and flexes with varying mobile screen sizes. AtlasCT is not targeting consumers directly. In a deal made with Nokia the mapping software comes pre-installed on all Nokia smartphones. They are currently seeking more OEM deals in the US and believe there is at least one camera manufacturer ready to incorporate GPS right into their device.</p>, <p>The OEM route seems like a smart move until GPS becomes more pervasive. Only a small percentage of US phones support GPS without some kind of Bluetooth addition (Helio and Boost support GPS over their whole network).

I’m branding this as an homage to the latest iPhone OS 2.2 upgrade, which surfaced a few days ago with limited fanfare centering mostly around new walking and public transportation views in Maps and improved memory and stability. But the new realtime podcast support is a very big deal even in its carrier-crippled limitations. Apple has opened the doorway to free audio and video content direct to the iPhone over both WiFi and radio, leveling the playing field for these media types with the rest of the Web.</p>, <p>In order to protect AT&amp;T from saturation of its 3G network, podcasts greater than 10MB will be queued for downloading the next time you enter WiFi range. You still have to use iTunes on the Mac or PC to subscribe to a show feed and automatically download each episode, but everything else is now open including streaming over 3G. I streamed this week’s Gillmor Gang, which runs a bit over an hour while on the road; it downloaded as soon as I got close enough to my house to switch to WiFi.</p>, <p>The Gang began just before podcasting became popular, and soon averaged double the downloads of streaming users. Of course, the iPhone and its radio access to the Web didn’t exist back then; hence the name podcasting. Direct downloading opened a small crack in the wall with the iTunes WiFi store, allowing direct purchase of songs over WiFi. Even 2.2 still won’t work with 3G, and of course streaming is not an option.</p>, <p>The election campaign brought new popularity to podcasting, as first Keith Olbermann and then Rachel Maddow made their MSNBC political shows available for download. I couldn’t stream Maddow’s video show over 3G but it displayed fine once downloaded, though videos from YouTube stream without issues. President-elect Obama has already started releasing his weekly Saturday addresses on YouTube, and promises press conferences and interactive Q&amp;A’s over the Net.</p>, <p>Coupled with reports of a <a href=""http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/11/21/orb-for-the-iphone-stream-your-media-everywhere/"">SlingBox-like iPhone Store approved application</a>, YouTube Live’s streamcast via Akamai, and parallel development on Android phones, there’s plenty of incentive for Apple to keep open an avenue for realtime media. But where will this disruption spread next?</p>, <p>Many observers, and some platform vendors, believe Flash is the gateway drug for realtime streaming video. The logic goes that Apple’s refusal to open the iPhone to Flash will eventually help Android or even a Silverlight-enabled Windows Mobile break free and allow those devices to pass iPhone in adoption and developer buyin. But the rapid rise of micromessaging suggests another outcome. If Apple allows enough flexibility via direct downloading and streaming to shift the cost of live video and audio to a subsidized advertising model, then users will stay put.</p>, <p>Specifically, Apple has opened the architecture to allow the reboot of podcasting through its gated iTunes index. It’s logical that some set of API constructs that emulate direct downloading, streaming, and text linking will be made available to developers to allow them to link these capabilities into a single user experience. Apple could charge for such applications, or make available a version of the API for such controller applications that in turn sells user behavioral data to advertisers or even send interactive offers to iPhone users in return for such “free” services.</p>, <p>In this possible future, micromessaging becomes the controller for realtime rich media streaming. FriendFeed already aggregates my various channels, sending announcements of new posts (or podcasts) over the bridge to Twitter and any other service in the chain. If behavior from my Follow cloud suggests I might want notification of some stream and I’m in WiFi range, I can initiate a stream while the program downloads in the background.</p>, <p>If I’m traveling out of range, the micromessaging service can order the news based on my current schedule and mix streaming and downloading to fit the consumption window. Think about it: which radio service makes more sense, what we have today or one that mines the thoughts, citations, and behavior of hundreds of followed peers and tracked alerts? Services such as Live Mesh are designed to mine just such social data to optimize media and information based on location, business imperatives, and strategic triage of realtime information.</p>, <p>Apple’s move may turn out to be just a hint of things to come, or it may signal Steve Jobs’ sense that the timing is right for money to be made in the free zone of podcasting. As Jason Calacanis said on this week’s Gillmor Gang (<a href=""http://gillmorgang.beta.techcrunch.com/2008/11/21/gillmor-gang-112108/"">around 1 hr 4 minutes in</a>), if he was running Microsoft, he’d make a click ad network free for the first quarter million dollars that a publisher makes, and give every advertiser coming in on the first million dollars they spend an extra 200,000 and do that 10,000 times with all the best advertisers in the world.</p>, <p>Or write an iPhone app that uses GPS data combined with streaming and download playback data to connect the virtual and physical worlds at the time of potential purchase. Say you’re running low on gas, and the sponsor of the Gillmor Gang offers a 5 cent discount per gallon less at his station on the corner you’re at. Say you’re planning to watch a certain show tonight but your affinity group says forget it by bailing 5 minute in. Say you authorize access to that data in return for free popcorn at the movie you went to instead.</p>, <p>Both Jason’s and the latter strategy strike at Google’s potential weakness. Microsoft can buy their way in to challenge the black box of Google’s ad engine, while the iPhone’s Free zone can harness the unique power of a person’s affinity group to more efficiently find the most appropriate answer to a specific user’s question. It’s the locus of a gesture-based economy, where advertisers must align with a user’s requirements in order to get his or her attention.</p>, <p>The promise of podcasting was to provide an avenue for expression free of the tyranny of broadcast mediocrity. The promise of micromessaging was to create an open, living, breathing index to the realtime Web. The promise of the iPhone was to release us from the grip of the cartels and free our data to our own devices. We’re close enough to taste it now, and it’s giving us something fun to talk about again.</p>]"

<small>The Sanyo Katana – Could a kid step on it and break it? Mine almost did!</small></p>, <p>I just got in a phone from an interesting MVNO, Kajeet. The service is aimed at kids and their parents and offers a few basic features that Mr. or Ms. Mom and Dad might like.<br/>
<span id=""more-760""></span><br/>
Kajeet currently offers the Sanyo Katana, the LG LX150 and 225, and the Nokia 6165i. Each “kit” comes with $5 airtime, some stickers, and a ham-handed attempt at sounding cool which, as far as I can tell might work on the tweens but would definitely be rumble the aesthetics of a 13-and-up.</p>, <p><img class=""center"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/March%202007/IMG_6134.jpg""/><br/>
<small>Stickers! For your phone! Phonestickers!</small><br/>
The service is fairly standard. Phones range from $49.99 to $99.99 and Kajeet offers free shipping. Voice calls are 10 cents a minute and SMS messages are 5 cents each. There is a 35 cent daily usage charge, which could eat into your fun, but is offered in lieu of cancellation charges. Mobile AIM is $6.99 per month and all the standard junk like ringtones and wallpaper cost a few bucks.</p>, <p><img class=""center"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/March%202007/kajeet2.gif""/><br/>
<small>Block little Johnny from calling Fiji at 3am.</small></p>, <p>The real draw, however, are the parental controls. Parents can block certain numbers, ensure that kids can only call a few pre-set numbers and not use their own “wallet,” and set blackout times for kids who might be a bit too chatty after lights out. Parents can create their own wallet to allow kids a spare bit of change if they run out of their own money and you can refill the phone online with a credit card.<br/>

The simple, utilitarian site is a shining example of how the p2p Web can work, and one of the secrets to its success is the anonymization of its users by email forwarding and masking. Many people who wouldn’t want their real email addresses published can use an anonymous, temporary @cragislist.org address to keep things private while maintaining email as a valid form of commercial communication.</p>, <p><span id=""more-764""></span></p>, <p>Gumiyo.com is working on a very similar concept, but for phone usage. Using its oh-so-Web 2.0 classified site to buy or sell items, a seller or buyer can be hooked up via telephone by using “disposable” phone numbers. If you find something you like, you enter your phone number and a verification code and hit “Send!”. Your number is auto-magically paired with a Gumiyo number and this number is sent to the seller. When he or she calls it, it basically forwards to yours. It even works with text messaging, a neat feature.</p>, <p>It’s free for sellers and buyers, and compliments Gumiyo’s other advanced features, like txtmsg notifications and threaded sale discussions.

Yahoo! Trailblazes With Its New Mobile Publisher Services,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""right"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/March%202007/SGE.jpg""/>Yahoo! has announced a new service that will be kind of a big deal for the mobile arena. Yahoo! Mobile Publisher Services is a suite of services designed to enable publishers to increase the discovery, distribution and monetization of their content on mobile phones. The suite is comprised of Yahoo! Mobile Ad Network, Mobile Content Engine, Mobile Media Directory and Mobile Site Submit. That’s a lot of mobile, so let’s take a look at what each of these products do.<br/>
<span id=""more-770""></span></p>, <p>The <strong>Yahoo! Mobile Ad Network</strong> aims to make it easy for mobile publishers to have syndicated advertising served along with their mobile content and services. Publishers are allowed a large degree of control over the the ads displayed along with their content — the service gives them options to adjust ad formats (display settings, etc.), sponsored links and video or in-game placement.</p>, <p>Launch partners include MobiTV, Opera and Go2, with more advertisers expected to sign on in the coming months. Y! has stated that the first round of advertisements will go live in the second quarter of 2007.</p>, <p>The services focus squarely on aiding mobile producers in their quest to distribute their wares. Chief amongst these offerings is the <strong>Mobile Content Engine</strong>, a product that greatly improves burgeoning developers’ chances of proliferating their content. The service provides producers of mobile content with the ability to make their content discoverable through <a href=""http://mobilecrunch.com/2007/03/20/yahoo-debuts-onesearch-mobile-portal/"">Yahoo! oneSearch</a>.</p>, <p>Yahoo! Mobile Content Engine is steered by the feature-set of <strong>Mobile Media Directory</strong>. This one is pretty transparent, but don’t think that somehow doesn’t diminish its value to the suite or the developers or, most of all, the consumer. Through the utilization of the Mobile Media Directory, Yahoo! Publisher Suite has taken a decisive step toward embracing user-driven mobile content. It provides an easy path for publishers to make their mobile media content accessible directly through oneSearch.</p>, <p>The service combines Yahoo!’s editorial knowledge and earch technology, as well as rating and reviews from Yahoo! community members, to push quality content along the path to recognition. For instance, information from a mobile game publisher could be made readily available through Mobile Media Directory. The data could show ratings and reviews that set it apart from competitors and direct people to the publisher’s mobile site where the games are available for demo or purchase.</p>, <p>Rounding out the Publisher Services is <strong>Yahoo! Mobile Site Submit</strong>.From what I gather, this is essentially a method of efficiently marking mobile sites for indexing by oneSearch. It can apply descriptions and relevant tags to content so that it can deciphered accurately and delivered to consumers in an effective matter.</p>, <p>It is important to consider the relationship of oneSearch and Publisher Services. The oneSearch service is Yahoo! premier method of mobile content distribution. By opening it up to mobile publishers Yahoo! is answering the call for decentralized, universal information that was sounded with the birth of the Internet and has carried through to present times with blogs, vlogs, any other type of log, and now, mobile content.</p>, <p>As innocuous as this may seem, this is a vital movement in the charge toward the independence of information. Before the Mobile Web has even really cleared the gate, Yahoo! has developed a mechanism for users to conveniently distribute and monetize their content. Not even considering its wireless availability, the Mobile Web is quickly being positioned at the center of technological world of tomorrow.</p>, <p>This is a pivotal moment for Yahoo! It has struggled for some time with its identity and ways to distinguish itself from the juggernaut that is Google search. A continued play at content delivery and a broadening of its scope as a information hub, rather than just an index, is undoubtedly an imperative step toward realizing its goals and seizing share from soon to be wildly active market before it comes too saturated.</p>, <p><a href=""http://mobile.yahoo.com/business""><br/>

Sonopia: Be Your Own MVNO,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://sonopia.com""><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/sonopialogo.png"" style=""float:left;""/></a>TechCrunch <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2007/04/02/build-your-own-mobile-company/"">just posted</a> about a new mobile startup called Sonopia. Sonopia lets you create you own mobile social network on top of Verizon’s phone service for fun and profit. Anyone can create a network (called Sonopia) in a couple of minutes. The idea is that organizations will build there own branded networks, attract subscribers, and provide exclusive content relevant to their users (news, blogs). A percentage of each member’s monthly mobile bill goes directly to the organization.</p>, <p>Subscribers can choose from a few different phones and calling plans along with additional MMS and WAP packages. For promotional purposes, networks can co-brand their own website to get people to sign up.</p>, <p>No one <strong>has</strong> to sign up for a mobile plan to be a part of a Sonopia. Instead, they can sign up for just the web component, where you can keep track of the news and friends within your network. However, it all seems pretty pointless to use this service if the majority of your users aren’t using the main feature of the service, the mobile plan.</p>, <p>There are plenty of well financed MVNOs currently slugging it out for you attention: Helio ($440 million), Amp’d ($260 million), and Boost. Helio, with its large marketing push this quarter,  is considering it a triumph to be <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2007/02/06/helio-subscriber-numbers/"">closing in on 100,000 users</a>. Mobile is in the midst of ever dwindling margins, relying on large networks to bring in the serious cash. If the big guys are having trouble building revenue on top of large subscriber numbers, Sonopia’s decentralized approach seems to give too little an incentive for smaller organizations and subscribers to invest time and money in switching to a new network.</p>]"

The intersection of social media and the cloud,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a class=""shot2"" href=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/nnw.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-778"" height=""240"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/nnw.jpg"" title=""nnw"" width=""426""/></a>The competition for the next wave of enterprise computing has heated up since Microsoft announced its Windows Azure strategy a month ago. While the jury is out in some quarters about Microsoft’s ability to actually deliver the reliability, security, and even the interoperability that is promised, the timetable has accelerated the plans of competitors and forced some to define themselves in terms of the cloud at a dangerous moment.</p>, <p>Sun Microsystems has been under particular pressure to realign; analysts and even Sun employees such as Tim Bray have been outspoken in their pleas for Sun’s executive team to jettison unprofitable ventures in favor of some kind of cloud strategy. CEO Jonathan Schwartz has hinted in recent months of some wood behind what Sun calls its Grid effort, and will this week roll out Sun’s JavaFX 1.0  front end technology to compete with Flash/Air and Silverlight.</p>, <p>JavaFX could be one of the casualties if Sun decides to pare technologies along with the 18% of its employees it’s trimming. Other cuts might include the NetBeans development environment, which has kept pace with or even bettered Eclipse in quality but not in uptake, and OpenOffice, the free Office replacement. Unfortunately for Sun, Google Docs has stolen some of the strategic thunder with an on-demand product from a company that can afford it.</p>, <p>Google is feeling some pressure as well, as its odd messaging around a Gmail Video chat plug-in reveals. Though the company has made a big deal about only supporting open Web technologies, they have much less to say about the use of proprietary technologies in the video plug-in. Coming at the same time that CEO Eric Schmidt <a href=""http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/16-12/ff_ozzie?currentPage=8"">attacks Azure</a> as a way “to gain enough share in cloud computing to force other people to use its standards,” the use of Flash and the reluctance to answer direct questions about it seem disingenuous, something Google has steered clear of as it builds out its own standards such as Chrome and Android.</p>, <p>Schmidt’s attack also suggests that Google has assessed Microsoft’s cloud effort and found it substantial enough to warrant a political rather than technical challenge. Yet the video plug-in also implies an attempt to improve the “rich” aspects of its Ajax framework as online versions of Office reach beta in the next year. Ironically, Microsoft’s Live Mesh/Silverlight combo will work on Windows, Mac, and Linux (via Novell’s Moonlight port), while no Linux plug-in has been announced for the video code.</p>, <p>Apple’s cloudish efforts may get a boost when the company releases its Push notification technology, allowing a rumored over the air MobileMe synchup with Notes. Not only would that bring in the rest of the enterprise email world, it would also deliver the necessary infrastructure for iPhone developers to release useful micromessaging clients. Qik.com’s new support for transcoded iPhone-compatible versions of Qik videos would fit nicely in such clients, bypassing Flash and Silverlight in the process and blunting pressure from Android. Without Google’s Web religion and with a burgeoning revenue model, Apple can afford to move to the cloud at its own pace.</p>, <p>At a time when startups are tamped down to survival mode, the cloud seems the province of the wealthy. By betting early and building just ahead of the startup market, Amazon has joined the gorillas at the table. Sun remains a player if only because the various acquisition or breakup scenarios seem more unlikely. And Jonathan Schwartz’ ability to dance with Microsoft when he needs it may come in handy as Azure nears the marketplace. Somebody will provide the big freaking Webtone switch for these cloud data centers, and storage is the new black.</p>, <p>Google and Microsoft are alone at the top of the pyramid. The usual caveats don’t hold much water when looked at objectively. For a company pigeon-holed as making it up as they go along with no cross team coordination, the Google desktop is an organic work in progress with new components and management tools emerging week by week. Building out via XMPP from the Gmail hub is allowing users to orchestrate realtime services into a consumable stream and reliable archives available cross-client.</p>, <p>The rogue video plug-in may violate Google’s messaging, but the first time you nail up a video chat with someone on a PC from your Mac, you’ll know something substantial has occurred. In a world where the console real estate is measured in pixels, I’m still running Skype as a legacy app but switching whenever I see the telltale camera icon in Gchat. With calendar, docs, mail, XMPP, video, and audio all on one screen, the momentum is considerable.</p>, <p>For its part, Microsoft is no longer at war with itself. That may have been the only way to manage the company in the face of no opposition, but for the first time Redmond is competing more with Google and to a lesser extent, Amazon, than between versions of Windows or Office. The Google console may lack persistence and offline aspects, but the video plug-in signals a much more pragmatic approach than many have expected. By the same token, Microsoft is far less encumbered with its response to Google’s attack than we thought before Azure was revealed.</p>, <p>That’s because users don’t perceive Microsoft as the dominant force in computing any more. When I open Gmail, I’m conditioned to expect the latest addition. The more time I spend in the realtime world, the more I look to solutions that will fit into the environment I have chosen. When micromessaging proves too fragmented for XMPP, I add the Twhirl Air client to present a more alert-driven version of the various feeds. In other words, my usage reaches a point where more professional tools are necessary, and I integrate RIA capabilities to finesse the transition.</p>, <p>But what happens next? For now, it’s unlikely I’ll switch off the Gmail desktop. There’s no competitive Ajax client, but I have no special allegiance to Air should a more robust Silverlight client emerge. My iPhone could care less where the back end lives that synchs via the new Push notification engine, so I can choose between Mesh and whatever Google releases to compete with XMPP on the desktop. Google has to compete not only with Microsoft but Apple in that arena; I’d love to integrate GCal and missing features of Gmail on the iPhone, but not until Push is released will it happen, and perhaps not quickly even then.</p>, <p>Micromessaging is not the only area where Microsoft can make inroads, but it’s easily the most significant because of the requirement for open standards. Even though those are still unsettled, Microsoft has carefully mandated open access to its platform and has no wiggle room out of that contract given its Borg baggage. Interestingly, Google has opened a hole into the Gmail console with the ability to add widgets. Imagine Office Online docs available on the Gmail console, or a Twitter feed that interleaves docs and appointments from both stores.</p>, <p>The intersection of social media and the cloud will drive most of this strategic realignment. The argument that cloud computing will fail because we won’t trust our bits outside our direct control ignores two truths: the economics outweigh the potential liabilities, and we have no idea where our data is in any case. The more valuable our cloud data becomes, the less likely we will be to complain about unauthorized access. The more social graph data is baked into these information sharing transactions, the more valuable the shared data will become.</p>]"

The interface to create your bio is question and answer based with nice ajax features. The result is a professional looking and easy to peruse bio. CollectiveX also has advanced calendar, message board,file storage and other features.</p>, <p>But the biggest difference between CollectiveX and Linkedin is that CollectiveX is completely group-focused. You must be associated with at least one group to join and all of the activity focuses on your groups. This makes a lot of sense – groups will form (each with its own subdomain) virally as members start new groups.</p>, <p>For instance, a board of directors group might use CollectiveX to coordinate board meetings via the calendar, upload board minutes for review, and use the discussion board to plan future meetings or follow up on action items.

A UK trial looms after O2 had a “successful” rollout with a 50 channel service to a whopping 70,000 customers in that hotbed of media, the Czech Republic the last year. O2 bought internet provider <a href=""http://www.bethere.com"">Be</a> last year, which has a fast IP network and already has deals with media companies including Warner Bros, HBO and Paramount. But there is the small matter of BT, Sky and Virgin Media to contend with as well as Orange. Plus, consider this: O2 has the rights to the national ice hockey league, the Czech  Republic’s favourite sport. The chances of it securing quality football rights in the UK against Sky or BT or Virgin? None.</p>, <p>To me, O2 is throwing money away on TV. TV is not a growth market, the Internet and mobile is. So why don’t they throw all of the investment they plan to put into this white elephant into really powering ahead in mobile? They already exclusively sell the greatest mobile Web browser known to mankind, the one inside the iPhone.

"Music Labels Looking Forward to WiMax, Profits","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""right"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/March%202007/story-1.jpg""/>We know WiMax as the 4G standard that will eventually supplant the current 3G wireless technologies. It’s cheap, it’s fast, and it’s being deployed now. While faster download speeds are good for you, the user, it’s the music labels and content providers who have the drool on their collective chin.</p>, <p>The concept that made the Internet so popular a decade ago was the idea of content on-demand. If you want to read something, you can, instantly. With the rise of home broadband penetration, that ethos has spread to multimedia. Missed last week’s episode of Lost? No problem, go to ABC and watch it whenever you’d like. The thing is, we’re becoming more and more mobile (thus this site), and the idea of putting high-bandwidth content in the palm of users hands (for a price) is a moneymaker all around.</p>, <p>Don’t take our word for it, though. Check out the nice summary Reuters has put together, including some general background on WiMax for some of our not-so-techy readers. There are many good points raised in the article, but the gist is this: more bandwidth for less money means more beefy, mobile downloads.</p>, <p><a href=""http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=technologyNews&amp;storyID=2007-04-09T033634Z_01_N08262344_RTRUKOC_0_US-WIMAX.xml&amp;pageNumber=0&amp;imageid=&amp;cap=&amp;sz=13&amp;WTModLoc=NewsArt-C1-ArticlePage3"">New WiMAX broadband technology a boon for labels</a> [Reuters, via <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/wireless/wimax-is-coming-and-the-music-industry-doesnt-want-to-miss-out-250769.php"">Gizmodo</a>]</p>]"

Is Apple Resurrecting the Cube?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""right""/>Before the Mac Mini, Apple experimented with the G4 Cube. The Cube was Steve Jobs’s fully capable, yet ultimately ill-fated,  foray into the world of computers-as-art.

I personally know a few people with Cubes, and they spend more money than they need to on upgrades and upkeep.</p>, <p>Apple appears to be at it again. Steve has a thing for cubes, and a recent patent filing shows a new “cubical computer housing” for an as-of-yet unannounced Mac.

Essentially it is an embeddable Flash media player (or widget) complete with a store.

EBay is Decadent and Depraved,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/> – so I’m going to come out and say it: eBay is now useless, especially for selling electronics. You might be OK if you’re selling a pot-holder shaped like a monkey, but trying to put a laptop, phone, or MP3 on there or attempting to purchase any of those items is fraught with danger and idiocy.</p>, <p>Case in point: I tried to sell a phone that I have lying around here, fairly new model. I don’t want to send out of the country because of customs and potential fraud, and Canada is out of the country. The first guy wins the phone and he’s in Alberta. Plus I get 15 messages asking me if I’ll ship to a cousin in Nigeria or if the phone has porn on it. So I try to sell it again and what happens? I get some guy who wants me to send the thing to Lagos. So that seller fee is in the toilet. Finally, I try to sell it again and they want me to send it to Russia and they’re offering a credit card up front. Hot damn. So essentially trying to sell anything of value on there is now almost impossible.</p>, <p>To answer the comments below, my listings only show I will ship to the continental U.S. The buyers had “continental” addresses — even the Canadian — in eBay but later, in email, asked me to ship outside of the country. Alberta I could have done, but the rest were obvious scams. The sales look legit until you communicate with them.</p>, <p>EBay used to be a fun place to buy and sell cool stuff. Now it is a commercial wasteland full of scammers and fools.

Two ads are served in the unit and there are vertical and horizontal ad units to choose from. For ever two ads served, the publishing blog gets an impression on another blog.</p>, <p>FeedShare is a service that helps bloggers with similar interests promote each other. As a blogger participant you give exposure on your site to other blogs in the network, and in return your blog will be promoted on similar sites in the network.</p>, <p>You give exposure by displaying “Feed Listings” (see examples) which display the name and description of blogs and other feed publishers. When visitors click on these listings they can then subscribe to the RSS or Atom feed for that blogger or publisher in any one of several feed readers.</p>, <p>You then create a listing for your OWN blog and for every impression you donate to the network on your blog, you will receive a listing on someone else’s blog or in Rojo.com. The goal is to help build the feed subscriber base to your blog, increasing awareness and traffic to your site.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Rojo plans to sell the second ad to third parties, first on a cost-per-impression basis. Later they may experiment with cost-per-click and cost-per-subscirber models as well.</p>, <p>Tags can be set by the blog publisher to control the types of ads shown on the site, as well as what types of sites your ads will be shown on.</p>, <p>Ads link back to Rojo and are recommended for subscription to Rojo or other feed readers.

Now it’s looking like we might have egg on our collective face.</p>, <p>Though people have been rumoring this stakes-raising iPod since the 5G was intoduced last year, those rumors have always been wrong. But with Apple rolling out the <a href=""http://crunchgear.com/2006/09/06/apple-releases-24-imac/"" target=""_blank"">new iMac</a> and <a href=""http://crunchgear.com/2006/09/06/mac-mini-updated-to-183ghz-and-166ghz-core-duo/"" target=""_blank"">Mac Mini upgrades</a> last week ahead of the September 12th event, and the “Showtime” theme of Tuesday’s special annoucement, there’s room for more than just a movie store. Apple has traditionally coulped a bigger annoucement with “One more thing…”, a surprise posing as an afterthought from Steve’s brain that sends us to work. The next “One more thing…” could actually, really, truly, for reals, be this new Video iPod, and there are a few reasons why.<span id=""more-825""></span></p>, <p>Among the now progressive DAP market, the 5th gen iPod has become elderly. Generally, we get a new iPod every year, with an update at about the six-to-eight-month mark. The current fifth-gen iPod has remained untouched. The specs and price haven’t changed since day one. At the very least, look for an update to this fine white (or black) Apple on Tuesday.</p>, <p>According to tipsters, national retailers of gadgets like Best Buy and Circuit City ran this weekend’s full-color ad inserts for newspapers sans iPods. Usually, you can find Apple’s MP3 players prominently featured, on sale or not. The lack of these devices could be evidence of greater things soon-to-come.</p>, <p>But the real meat and potatoes comes from a photo making the rounds of the Apple rumor circuit, posted above. It shows a supposed banner being hoisted this weekend for Tuesday’s Apple event. It shows an iMac, the word “the stars”, and what appears to be a wide-screen iPod-like device. Could this be the “true” Video iPod? Or clever Photoshoppery? Or perhaps an interface for the set-top streaming-video box we’ve been hearing about? We’ll find out Tuesday, but we’re still excited. My money is on this being a fake, but I’m the Scully to the other iPod rumor sites’s Mulder.</p>, <p>Keep it tuned here on Tuesday to get the real skinny, as we’ve got a man on the inside, and you know we have to keep you guys ready.

Nintendo DS 40GB Hard Drive Mod,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""center"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/gbamp-ide.jpg""/></p>, <p>So you bought a Nintendo DS, and now you’re wishing you had a PSP. The DS just doesn’t have the storage capacity to watch those illegally downloaded midget porns, or listen to that new Yanni record that everybody’s talking about. Well, one of our Canadian neighbors has come up with a solution that might appeal to you. Take the thing apart, take all the IDE connections from the CompactFlash connection and solder them to your IDE hard drive contacts. Give the thing a little extra juice from a 11.1V li-poly battery, and you can put any hard drive you want on it. Now, it isn’t the prettiest mod I’ve ever seen and it’s not incredibly mobile, but it is a good example of what a little hard work, some determination and no sex life can do for you. Besides, who doesn’t want porn on 2 screens at the same time?</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.natrium42.com/blog/?p=39"">IDE to NDS Connection</a> [natrium42.com]</p>]"
iBreath Could Save You from DUI Ruination,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""right"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/ibreath.jpg""/></p>, <p>Another day, another seemingly useless iPod accessory. This thing serves 2 functions, FM transmitter and, more interestingly, breathalyser. The guys selling the iBreath are saying you should use it before you drive to find out if you’re actually sober enough to drive, but I have a feeling this is going to be used a lot more when your buddies are sitting around the apartment and somebody claims to be the drunkest in the room, and somebody else argues that they are actually the most drunk. If you are, however, inclined to use this thing for its intended purpose, you should probably keep it in your glove compartment.

This week they <a href=""http://blog.meebo.com/?p=107"">have announced a new set of features and upgrades</a> to their application, the first since they announced their <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/12/16/meebo-confirms-sequoia-funding/"">funding from Sequoia capital</a>.</p>, <p>The best of the new features are that you can now create an account with Meebo and have access to all your instant messaging accounts with a single sign-on. The problem I have had to date with Meebo is that I do have a number of different accounts on different networks but the single sign-on and having a Meebo account solves that. They have added some cool features to it such as being able to sign in with a default status of invisible, see all your contacts across all networks in a single list, and having as many accounts as you wish. Single sign-off is coming shortly I am told.</p>, <p>I was <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelarrington/100294765/"">at a dinner</a> with Meebo co-founder <a href=""http://blog.meebo.com/?page_id=2"">Seth Sternberg</a> during the week and he talked about these new features, the continuing growth as well as Meebo’s plans for the future. These guys are working on some exciting things and are now handling their large load of users well with more servers. Their growth is still extremely strong: they hit a new record of 396,000 connections in a day last week.</p>, <p>I am using Meebo as my full-time instant messaging client from today – and it is working well so far. Many of the incremental improvements have made the experience enjoyable for the user. It will be interesting to see how the competition responds to what Meebo are doing and if they will be able to sustain this growth over the next few months and beyond.</p>]"

Flyspy Brings The New Web To Airline Ticketing,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.flyspy.com""><img alt="""" class=""shot2"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/0003.thumbnail.jpg"" style=""float:right;""/></a></p>, <p>At the <a href=""http://www.mashupcamp.com"">Mashup Camp</a> pre-conference dinner tonight there were a number of demos, all of which were interesting. A non-public service that stood out was <a href=""http://www.flyspy.com"">flyspy</a>, a search engine for airline tickets that will change the way we all travel. Purchasing flights purely based on price has been around for a while, but the consumer has never had the power to quickly and at a glance evaluate the cheapest days to fly nor the cheapest destinations to fly to. Flyspy reverse engineers some of the mystique associated with the airline industry and makes it extremely transparent.</p>, <p>Tonight I got a look at the service, and while it is still in it’s early stages it is very cool. The way it works is that I give it a departure city and a destination city and optionally a departure date and length of stay. The search result, which returns very quickly, will present me with a graph of flight prices over the next 30 days so that I can quickly look at which days are the cheapest to fly. To book a flight I just click on the point in the graph. Simple.</p>, <p><img alt=""FlySpy"" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/0001.jpg"" style=""float:left;""/></p>, <p>If I am trying to decide which destination is cheaper, I can overlay another airport on the graph and then compare the results. In the screenshot you can see that it has plotted the prices for arriving in both San Francisco and San Jose. The end result is that in very little time I can find the best day to fly out, the best price and also the best destination.</p>, <p>Flyspy has all the right elements – a good idea, a simple user interface and an immediate value proposition for the user. Even better, it takes an industry that is stuck in the old times and shakes it up (I was going to say <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/087584877X/102-3696105-0628163?v=glance&amp;n=283155"">blown to bits</a>).</p>, <p>Flyspy was founded by Robert Metcalf (no <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Metcalfe"">not that one</a>) who has been working on the problem for 2 years after experiencing frustrations with the airline booking system (someone pissed off the wrong programmer). Even though he had no previous experience in the industry Robert was obviously very knowledgeable on how it all worked and how to build a business from what he has built so far.</p>, <p>Flyspy will have an API that will allow other developers to tap into its technology and to integrate it with other services. Robert is expecting to move out to the valley sometime soon and has been self-funded to date (though he is in the process of seeking investment). Overall a very cool service that epitomizes what the new web is about. Flyspy should go public in a few months – you will hear more about it here and probably feel the distruption.</p>]"
Foldera: Never organize your inbox again,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.foldera.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>Huntington Beach, California based <a href=""http://www.foldera.com"">Foldera</a>‘s goal is to organize all of the chaos surrounding work based documents (email, calendar, office documents, instant messaging, etc). It is a very big idea.</p>, <p>The company is in private beta right now, with a full launch on the way.</p>, <p>Foldera’s approach to productivity is in direct conflict with the way we use applications like Outlook today (just think about how much time we all spend organizing our inbox, filing emails, etc.). Foldera has a better approach (one that seems rather obvious now that I’ve seen it) and they have a chance to seriously disrupt upcoming product launches like <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/tag/Office-Live/"">Office Live</a> from Microsoft.</p>, <p>Most of us are used to working with email folders today, where an email message can simply be pulled into a folder for easier discovery later. The idea around Foldera starts there. They’ve created an Ajax rich web application that includes email, calendaring, instant messaging, document storage and versioning, tasks and other features into a single web application. Everything is folder-centric:</p>, <p><strong>How does this work?</strong></p>, <p>You create a dedicated Activity Folder for each distinct project or activity. Email, instant messaging, and all your other applications are now accessed from within this folder instead of their original disconnected and unstructured state. This organizational structure also keeps everything in context; for example, all your email conversations and instant message dialogs stay right inside that specific Activity Folder, so everything related to that project stays grouped together. Doesn’t that make more sense?</p>, <p><strong>Do you work with other people?</strong></p>, <p>To truly appreciate what Foldera can do, try using it with a team. Everything you create with Foldera can be shared or kept private, delegated, owned, or distributed among one, several, or all members of a team. Unlike some collaborative applications, Foldera is easy to use and requires virtually no learning curve. If you can send email, you can use Foldera.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>Richard Lusk, Foldera’s CEO, met with me late last year to show me an early demo of the product. The idea is that you create a folder around any new project. Share that folder with others or keep it private. <a href=""http://www.foldera.com/documentmanager.htm"">Documents</a> can be uploaded to the service and associated with a folder. <a href=""http://www.foldera.com/email.htm"">Emails</a> started from within the folder are automatically associated with the project. Same with <a href=""http://www.foldera.com/calendar.htm"">Calendar</a> entries. Foldera also includes an <a href=""http://www.foldera.com/instantmessenger.htm"">instant messaging</a> application (it works with MSN Messenger, Google Talk, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), iChat, and Yahoo Messenger).</p>, <p>The notion of taking emails, IM transcripts, office documents, calendar items and more and automatically organizing each document into shared or private folders is a big deal. Having one place to see every related document will save time. And as deadlines approach, users can simply focus on the project folder and ignore distracting emails and IMs that deal with other projects.</p>, <p>Pricing has not yet been disclosed, but there will be a generous free option.</p>, <p>Foldera has raised $13 million since its launch. Last week it completed a reverse merger into an existing (shell) public company, raising an additional $8.5 million. It is now a <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=EXSM.OB&amp;d=t"">publicly traded</a> (OTC) company with a market capitalization of $70 million.

BlogBeat Rocking The Blog Stat Beats!,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""blogbeat"" class=""shot"" height=""45"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/logo.gif"" style=""float:left;"" width=""106""/></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.google.com"">Google </a>recently indicated that they are taking blogs and measuring blog statistics very seriously with their acquisition of <a href=""http://www.measuremap.com"">Measure Map</a>. Measure Map had not yet made it into the hands of most bloggers and had been in a private beta at the time of acquisition. A new blog analytics tool that is similar in functionality to Measure Map is <a href=""http://www.blogbeat.net"">BlogBeat</a>. The different with BlogBeat is that it is available to everyone now.</p>, <p>A few days ago I installed BlogBeat on <a href=""http://www.nik.com.au"">my own blog</a> – the installation procedure involved copying a snippet of HTML into the footer template of my <a href=""http://wordpress.org"">WordPress </a>install (it will work with any blogging application where you can edit and access the template). The process of signing up and installing took no longer than a minute, and I was able to instantly see who was accessing my site along with all the other statistics the service provides. BlogBeat will read information about your blog, as well as derive post statistics, from the RSS feed URL that you need to specify.</p>, <p>The front page of BlogBeat displays to the user an overview of their traffic stats and highlites trends. You will need to have the code running for a few days to get meaningful data from this front page – for example the monthly summary does not mean much unless you have been running the package for a month (perhaps something that should be hidden until then). The interface to BlogBeat is very simple and clean, not as attractive as the interface for MeasureMap but at the same time very practical.</p>, <p>BlogBeat being blog-specific can tell you statistics such as which posts are the most popular, which categories are popular and also tracks comments to tell you which posts are most commented and what the most recent comments are. With post statistics it also displays trends, though with most statistic packages shows you that the fastest growing posts or pages are the most recent (since they didn’t exist yesterday the ‘growth’ is always 600%+) – something else that should be accounted for if the intention is to make clear older posts that may have become popular again for whatever reason (something that is common on my own blog).</p>, <p>Further there are areas that describe where your visitors are coming in from, how they have found your blog or a specific post and what keywords have been used to find your site via search engines. The last section describes which outbound links are the most popular and from which points users are leaving your page. One simple feature that BlogBeat doesn’t show me that others do is what browsers my visitors are using, though this isn’t the most useful stat it is good to know. I am sure that we will see this feature shortly. They are also working hard on <a href=""http://www.feedburner.com"">FeedBurner</a> integration (its there already, see my update at the end of this post) and have cool features like being able to subscribe to your stats (BlogBeat will also have an API).</p>, <p>I found overall that BlogBeat is a much better way of tracking my sites visitors (though I am not surprisingly a stats-obsessed blogger, I know a lot who are) over <a href=""http://google.com/analytics"">Google Analytics</a> (overkill). The concerns I have with the javascript include method of tracking stats is that first it can slow down page loading if the tracking app is experiencing heavy load (something that visitors to blogs which are being tracked by Measure Map have probably experiences) and second that using Javascript may not be a true representation of all visitors since some browsers wont execute it and others may not be able to (the developers still need to make sure the tracking code works on all browsers such as Safari etc.) . The alternative is to use a statistics package that can access server logs directly, but with that you sacrifice ease of installation and not all bloggers have such access to their servers.</p>, <p>BlogBeat is free for the first 30 days and thereafter it is $6 per month (limit to 500,000 page views per month, not sure what happens if you exceed). They currently have around 400 users and the performance is good, only time will tell if that will hold up. It is good to see more competition in this space and some good offerings. I will stick with BlogBeat for now and decide before the trial expires if I am getting $6 a month worth of value out of it.</p>, <p><b>Update</b>: John from BlogBeat emailed me to say that they do have demographic and browser stats (I just didn’t see it because it was at the bottom), and Feedburner integration is there now. This is a great solution already with a lot more to come</p>, <p><img alt=""00011.JPG"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/00011.jpg"" width=""450""/></p>]"

Tangler Untangling Communication On The Web,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""tangler"" class=""shot2"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/mail.google.com.jpg""/></p>, <p>Over the weekend I spoke to Martin Wells, the founder and CEO of a startup from Sydney, Australia called <a href=""http://www.tangler.com"">Tangler</a>. I had a look at the application they have been developing for the last 18 months now which is an instant messaging and communication app that is based around a concept they call ‘instant grouping’.</p>, <p>Instant grouping means that any number of people can take part in conversations around topics of interest they find on the web or in other applications. The application allows users to subscribe to a group – which can then be linked to any number of blogs, websites, music files (in iTunes or other apps), a point on a map or anything else. The conversations are persistent so you don’t need to be there when other people are and the desktop application will notify you when something new happens in a group.</p>, <p>This alleviates the problem some have seen at the moment with instant messaging applications tied to blogs by making each group an actual destination where users can make comments and have conversations. Tangler does a good job of uniting people around a common interest and letting them take part in conversations. This is where instant messaging has been heading for a while now, but Tangler looks to have gotten it right.</p>, <p>The guys have been spending some time in the valley recently while they prepare the company and the product for a public launch. Tangler has been privately funded to date but Martin has indicated they have investment interest from the USA at the moment which they are considering.</p>, <p>Tangler are planning to open up the private beta in 2 months – in the interim you can register your interest in their product on their website. I am eagerly awaiting the launch since I have seen many attempts at trying to make communication around a topic or website on the web easier and it seems that these guys are approaching it the right way and doing it well.</p>]"

Google Pages Released,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""google page creator logo"" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/googlepagecreater_logo.jpg""/></p>, <p>Although there has been no official announcement yet <a href=""http://www.google.com"">Google </a>have released the long awaited and long-rumored <a href=""http://pages.google.com"">Google Pages</a> (which has nothing to do with cloning Larry Page). Pages allows users to create a webpage using an AJAX interface that removes a lot of the ‘pain’ associated with creating pages with HTML and other desktop design applications. If you have some time on your hands and would like to try this out, then head over to <a href=""http://pages.google.com"">http://pages.google.com</a> to signup. If you have an existing Google account (they snuck that on us, didn’t they) then getting a pages account is very simple.</p>, <p>Once you are in the application you are presented with a WYSIWYG interface displaying your page and some editing controls. The interface in terms of what they have done with client-side Javascript is impressive, and what Google has done in terms of putting up simple pages is cool but overall it is an underwhelming gimmick that may have some potential if they focus. Google Pages allows you to upload files, create many pages that you can link up, and select from a smorgasbord of templates. The website which you can then push out to publish can then be found at username.googlepages.com.</p>, <p>I went through and created my own page which can be found at <a href=""http://cubrilovic.googlepages.com"">http://cubrilovic.googlepages.com</a>. The retro look demonstrates the problem with giving your content creators too much control and not wrapping them up more tightly into a nice template. The way it usually works with real website design is that the design wraps the content creator up completely simply so they don’t mess things up – only because we aren’t all creative types. Google Pages does let you upload any file though, and gives you 100MB of space, which some may find more useful for sharing files or distributing <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/20/business/media/20youtube.html?ex=1298091600&amp;en=06f4e30a6c8e7da2&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss"">SNL </a>video’s.</p>, <p>For instance, this is not going to be a threat to the younger crowd who are all creating pages on <a href=""http://www.myspace.com"">MySpace</a>, nor to the audience of millions of bloggers who already have their online presence, nor to the players in the <a href=""http://ww.opensourcecms.org"">CMS </a>space who offer a whole lot more in functionality and power. I am not sure who this is targeted at as the small business owners and non technical folk sure aren’t looking at Google for a website solution and considering there is no domain mapping at the moment being a business and handing out a googlepages.com domain is just, well, <em>embarrassing</em>.</p>, <p>I don’t think we will see a huge swell in the number of serious websites hosted on pages, but this may be a step towards a CMS suite for small businesses that would include some form of super-blogger, along with free domain registration or some of the other features that <a href=""http://officelive.microsoft.com/"">Office Live</a> will be offering.

The team at Mabber were early adopters of the Jabber protocol and with the lower mobile data charges in their home country decided to develop an application that would allow mobile users to communicate with each other using the protocol, thus save on SMS costs. Mabber is a product of New Media Management, a German company that runs some of the countries largest web properties such as <a href=""http://neu.de"">neu.de</a> and <a href=""http://pkw.de"">pkw.de</a>,</p>, <p><img alt=""mabber-screen2.jpg"" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/mabber-screen2.jpg""/></p>, <p>Mabber have put together a very experienced and solid team that totals six people, starting with <a href=""http://lumma.de"">Nico Lumma</a> who runs the team and directs the business (he is also a very popular blogger in Germany). Other members of the team include <a href=""http://fholzhauer.de/b/"">Florian Holzhauer</a> (who is a member of the Jabber foundation), <a href=""http://zeank.in-berlin.de/"">Stefan Strigler</a>, <a href=""http://bildschirmarbeitzplatz.blogg.de"">Jens Ohlig</a>, Oliver Lauer and Christian Horchert.</p>, <p>Mabber primarily uses the Jabber protocol but they also have support for the other networks such as MSN, Yahoo!, AIM – this is so that you don’t need to lose contacts or functionality with your existing IM provider in switching to mabber. Mabber supports all these protocols in-line, meaning that once you have the account setup you see your contacts on that network along with your other contacts from other networks and the primary mabber network.</p>, <p>There are two parts to the mabber application. The first is the web application which can be accessed from any browser. As with Meebo, these guys have spent a lot of time on refining the user experience. The first thing I noticed was that the chat windows did not have any re-draw effects and seemed to work seamlessly – no weird delays with the client polling the server, just instant reactions. Second what I noticed is all the rich features. They have extended through all the popular features of desktop IM clients such as chat history (which can be fully searched later), grouping (and group chat), and context menu’s to bring up the options.</p>, <p><img alt=""mabber-screen1.jpg"" class=""shot2"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/mabber-screen1.jpg""/></p>, <p>The web interface on it’s own will give Meebo a run for it’s money, but the magic with Mabber is on mobile devices. To install the mobile application you go to the site and enter your mobile number, you in return receive an sms with a download link, you follow that, it installs, executes, you enter your username and password and you are online. From that point you are able to access all your IM contacts and communicate with them using a standard mobile keypad. This will save people a lot on SMS costs (which are just blatant robbery in most countries at the moment) and allow people to communicate more effectively. I know that this is not the first mobile IM app, but the combination of this team, the protocol they have chosen, their simple application and both mobile and browser based interfaces means that Mabber stand a strong chance of success.</p>, <p>I have been using Mabber for almost a day now and I am currently evaluating if this is my Meebo replacement. Nico has been talking about a few features they have due during the course of this week including tabbed chatting windows, content delivery to mobile devices and other improvements. These guys are releasing very frequently and their private beta has been going well to date. They intend on going out strong in the German market and I am sure they will do well in other markets especially if ordinary consumers find the service as easy to install and use as I did.</p>, <p><b>Use Mabber Now:</b> Mabber have been kind enough to give away 50 beta invitations for Techcrunch readers. If you would like to check out a really cool IM app that works on mobile devices then send through an email to info@mabber.com with the subject line of ‘TECHCRUNCH!!!!!’ and you will be sent an invitation in return.</p>]"

China to Cut Mobile Charges,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""china_flag.jpg"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/china_flag.jpg""/>TeleCom Asia is reporting that China’s Ministry of Information Industry (MII) has said on its official Web site that China should implement one-way charging in an all-round way, while cutting down general charges for telecom services. MII will also reduce the domestic roaming charges by lowering the ceiling price, which has yet to be defined.

Escape the browser?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a><img alt="""" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-866"" height=""311"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/schwartzjavafx.jpg"" title=""schwartzjavafx"" width=""422""/></a>Sun’s difficult position has been covered here, in business circles, and even in the land of puppets. So when Jonathan Schwartz surfaces with the launch of JavaFX 1.0, naturally the question in everyone’s mind is how exactly a client technology is going to advance Sun’s position in the marketplace as it downsizes to avoid a possible collapse.</p>, <p>Schwartz comes out swinging in the video embedded below, talking of Java’s strong position on desktops and what he calls the majority of mobile devices. He frames the discussion around the desire of companies to escape from the lock-in of the browser, dividing the world conceptually between Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Google Chrome (presumably including Firefox and its growing share.) As he details a range of screens through which to project Java power, you can even see an iPhone on the far right though Java, like Flash, is shut out of the Apple smartphone.</p>, <p>The basic pitch is that the browser is hostile territory, and JavaFX allows you (producer and customers) to literally drag an application out of the browser frame and deposit it on the desktop – therby allowing the user to reconnect back to the producer without going through the browser. It’s an effective metaphor, buttressed by Schwartz’s suggestion that the Java virtual machine is the highest performance virtual machine in the marketplace and therefore capable of running 9 hi def video images in realtime.</p>, <p>This is a classic Schwartz framing of the market, positioning the bigcos as siphoning away the underlying business from independent companies – the Fortune 500, media companies, and so on – who have Java somewhere in their IT infrastructure. Java has a global developer constituency, a mature enterprise application foundation, and with JavaFX and associated tools for both NetBeans and Eclipse, a framework for extending the browser in much the same way Microsoft is doing with Silverlight and Adobe with Flash.</p>, <p>As a check off on the list of things to do to keep pace in the rush to the cloud, JavaFX is late but not fatally so. The economic crisis seems to be putting some much needed bounce in Sun’s step, a respite from the somewhat Zen-like open source strategy that Schwartz has lathered on all announcements for the past several years. But competing with Microsoft and its deep pockets on the one hand while being sliced and diced with forking and outright banning of Java across the mobile space on the other has to be troubling for Sun’s board and potential buyers.</p>, <p>How Sun approaches the cloud will likely tell the tale. As Schwartz says about the current climate: Get reach and then get rich. Build an audience, build a user base, then go out and figure out how to make money. Good advice for both Sun and its customers.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.kyte.tv/flash.swf?v=2&amp;uri=channels/87522/285957&amp;tbid=k_19"">http://www.kyte.tv/flash.swf?v=2&amp;uri=channels/87522/285957&amp;tbid=k_19</a></p>]"
Exclusive Look At Google Payments,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""google base logo"" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/googlebase.gif""/></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.google.com"">Google </a>announced <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/02/update-on-payments_24.html"">last week on their blog</a> that they will begin to facilitate payments on Google Base in the near future. The blog post from Google pointed out that Google are already accepting payments on their <a href=""http://video.google.com"">video service</a> as well as when users purchase software such as <a href=""http://earth.google.com"">Google Earth</a> and that this will be extended further in the near future. The latest updates to <a href=""http://base.google.com"">Google Base</a>, which we have been able to take a good look at, is to compete directly with <a href=""http://base.google.com"">eBay </a>by not only allowing sellers to post items to base, but also by facilitating the transaction through Google Payments (see <a href=""http://googlebase.blogspot.com/2006/02/buying-on-google-base.html"">this blog post</a> on purchasing via Base from the Google Base team).</p>, <p>To see some items on Google Base that are accepting payments via Google go to base.google.com and search for either ‘<a href=""http://base.google.com/base/search?q=xyzzy&amp;btnG=Search+Base"">xyzzy</a>‘ for a list of items with payments enabled, or ‘<a href=""http://base.google.com/base/search?q=magic+unicorn+beanie&amp;btnG=Search+Base&amp;authorid=1000430"">magic unicorn beanie</a>‘ for a particular item. The first thing you see is that a price has been set and you can see that the payment method that is accepted is ‘payment through google’. While ordinary users now won’t get an option to purchase these items, we managed to get some screenshots of how the process will look and work. The next set of screens show the items that had a big ‘buy’ button on them so that the user can purchase them:</p>, <p><img alt=""google payments #1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/googlepayments1.jpg""/></p>, <p><img alt=""google payments #1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/googlepayments2.jpg""/></p>, <p><img alt=""google payments #1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/googlepayments3.jpg""/></p>, <p><img alt=""google payments #1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/googlepayments4.jpg""/></p>, <p><a href=""http://payments.google.com"">The payments site</a> currently redirects to your Google account details but upon public launch, and available on very few select accounts at the moment, the user will have the option to specify or update their credit card details as well as their delivery address details. This means that as a user of Google Payments you won’t need to re-enter this information when making a purchase on Base, or any of the other services from Google that will be taking advantage of the new system. In addition on your account page you will see a history of items that you have purchased and you will be able to check the delivery status of items being delivered, as well as information about the seller of items you have purchased.</p>, <p><img alt=""google payments #1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/googlepayments5.jpg""/></p>, <p><img alt=""google payments #1"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/googlepayments6.jpg""/></p>, <p>Our understanding is that Google is currently testing this service further internally and are in talks to potential sellers on using Google Base and their new payment system to sell items. From the users point of view, it makes purchasing items on any Google property extremely simple. The checkout process is extremely quick and much faster than <a href=""http://www.paypal.com"">Paypal’s </a>(page loading times are Google fast) – it also has a much nicer interface making it easier for a user to navigate their way through a checkout and purchase. Overall with Google Base and payments the experience for a user is much nicer than what it is on eBay, a very nice interface and many search features while maintaining the very minimal yet functional interface as expected from Google. I can see that they will be able to maintain this nice interface even as the inventory of items for sale gets much much bigger – their choice of using tags for items as opposed to categories makes it much easier to find items and to fine-tune search results.</p>, <p>What Google does lack at the moment, and something they are working on, is a reputation system so that you can authenticate who the seller is and how trustworthy they are. Building a good reputation system is a very big problem, one that eBay has yet to completely solve so it will be interesting to see what Google will do about this. I don’t know if launching without a reputation system is a good idea, their short-term solution may be to restrict sellers using their payment system to more trusted sources.</p>, <p>What we are seeing here from Google is a direct shot at eBay’s market, as well as other services such as <a href=""http://ww.craigslist.org"">Craigslist </a>– though they have some way to get there. The new payments system means we should see many more services and offerings from Google in the future that cost money, it has made Google Base a lot more interesting and also started up a much needed additional source of revenue.</p>]"
Lafayette Fiber Case Going to State Supreme Court,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""right"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/fiber.jpg""/></p>, <p>Being from Louisiana, I kind of always thought of Lafayette as one of the most backward cities in the country.

The city has been trying to get fiber run citywide for over a year now, and the guys in charge have been trying everything in their power to make sure it doesn’t happen. This has cost the city money and time.</p>, <p>Last Friday, the Louisiana Municipal Association filed what is known as a “friend of the court” brief with the Louisiana Supreme Court on Friday. It pretty much amounts to a plea to the Supreme Court to let them start laying the cable.

Motorola Gets “Smellphone” Patent,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""motorola.JPG"" class=""left"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/motorola.jpg""/>Mobile phones can provide sounds easily enough, and even sights. If you count the vibration call alert that’s three of the senses covered, but soon Motorola mobile handsets could also provide smell! Information Week is reporting that last month Motorola received a patent for a “communication device having a scent release feature and method thereof.” This basically turns the cellular phone into a wireless-capable “Glade Plugin” adds Information Week. The technology could work by using the phone’s battery to heat a replaceable scent pack, which would in turn release the fragrance, and even overpower local odors when necessary. “Plug-in units typically provide a stronger scent over a broader area than non-plug-in scented items, given that the scents are activated by the heat energy,” explains the patent. So soon you’ll be able to stimulate four of the senses!</p>, <p><a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/s/cmp/20070512/tc_cmp/199501010"">Motorola Granted Patent For ‘Smellophone’</a> [Information Week via Yahoo]</p>]"
Edgeio Launches,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""edgeio"" class=""shot2"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/edgeio.jpg""/></p>, <p>After much anticipation and a period of being available to a private audience the team at <a href=""http://www.edgeio.com"">Edgeio </a>took the covers off of their creation tonight and launched to the general public. Edgeio takes listings (classifieds) from RSS-enabled sources and organizes them in a central location for users to be able to browse and search. The Edgeio ethos is that content belongs on the edges, and that is where the name originates from (Edge input/output). Content on the edges means the content on the millions of blogs and other sites out there which Edgeio does a good job of aggregating and organizing.</p>, <p>From a seller’s perspective, to post an item you write about it on your blog and tag it ‘listing’ (along with any other keywords which are suitable to categorize the item for sale). Edgeio taps into the blog cloud via weblogs.com and other ping services (as well as its own ping server which is at <a href=""http://www.edgeio.com/RPC2"">http://www.edgeio.com/RPC2</a>) to find new posts that have been tagged for listing. Once it finds your post, which usually happens very quickly, it will send a trackback to your post to make you aware that Edgeio has found it. Once you have posted, the first time you post an item you will need to go to Edgeio to claim your blog (a process that works similar to Technorati’s) from which point you can add additional metadata to your listing within Edgeio. The additional data you enter includes things like additional tags to categorize the item, your geographic location (which again you only enter once and is used when you search for items to buy as well) and the price of the item. It only takes moments from the time you post your listing to the time that it appears in Edgeio and is available for buyers to find.</p>, <p><img alt=""geo slider"" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/edgeio2.jpg""/></p>, <p>From a buyers perspective, you can go to Edgeio and then find items that are for sale a number of ways. The first and most obvious way is to enter terms into the search box. This will display results which are item summaries sorted in chronological order. The other way to find items is by browsing through the tag clusters that are located on the front page and working your way down to items that interest you. The last way in which you can find items is interesting, as Edgeio has lists of most popular items, the latest items and the most active weblogs posting items. The popular items list and the latest items list have feeds available for users to subscribe to or use in other applications. One cool thing you notice is the geography slider widget that is persistently in the sidebar while you are looking through items. If you are looking at search results and would like to filter them down to just the state you are in, or the zip code you are in, then you just slide the slider. I have been told that this slider will be even more fine-grained in the near future by giving ‘slide points’ which are certain distance radiuses around the current points (eg. Within 10 miles of your current post code). The way the slider works and refreshes the results or the page automatically has been very well implemented and makes a lot of sense. The interface has been very well done, it is clean and easy to understand (I tested this by handing over the URL to a non-tech user and they were able to find listings the may be interested in).</p>, <p>Throughout the search results, listings from blogs that have been claimed gain precedence over unclaimed listings. In the future sellers will have the ability to highlight their listing for a small fee. Reputation is currently handled via third party sites, the seller has an option to associate their listing with their Flickr, eBay or LinkedIn account so that their credibility can be traced back. It appears at the moment that a lot of the transactions on Edgeio will be face-to-face transactions, where verifying credibility is different as opposed to when you are sending payment to somebody you don’t know in a foreign country or another state.</p>, <p>The whole point of Edgeio is to connect the buyer and seller through its platform that aggregates listings, so there are no payment options at the moment nor can you see any account history from buyers or sellers on what they have purchased or sold before. It is currently being left up to the buyer and seller to close the transaction. Edgeio also offers a lot of social controls as a means to keep the listing relevant and current. Users are able to mark a listing as being ‘bad’ by telling Edgeio that the item is spam, that it is no longer current, that is hasn’t been categorized correctly or that the publishers information is not accurate. These forms of social controls and filtering work well on sites such as Craigslist and their effect on Edgeio and how well they work to prevent spam will only be known over time.</p>, <p>On important aspect to Edgeio is the availability of feeds for every part of the system. With standard RSS feeds (<a href=""http://www.scripting.com"">Dave Winer</a> is an advisor to the company) developers of other applications or webmasters are able to include items for sale on Edgio into their own sites or applications, or take the listings further in some form of a mashup (I am guessing we will see the first mashups – potentially with Google Maps, shortly). I like the idea of being able to subscribe to a feed that will display new items that may not be available now but I wish to purchase – so I will see them as soon as they are posted.</p>, <p>I subscribe to the theory that the publishing and control of content belongs to the user and that we are heading in that direction. There are a few reasons for this, the first and most important is that the user owns his or her data, even if it is something as simple as a classified listing, so the user should be able to have effective control over the environment where this data is contained. With centralized services such as <a href=""http://www.ebay.com"">eBay </a>and <a href=""http://www.craigslist.org"">Craigslist </a>the buyer and seller are left to the mercy of the platform provider. Blogging has enabled users to create content and publish it on the web easily, so using that platform for listings is only one of a number of potential services that can be built on top of what we have today. The short-term barriers I foresee are the size of this market today and how effective Edgeio will be in promoting itself as the standard place for listings. In terms of scalability, only a much larger inventory will be able to test the theory of having tags and tag clusters as a directory as opposed to a rigid directory structure (which is very hard to maintain and expand). Edgeio is putting categorization and the categories themselves into the hands of users with self-monitoring in place that will attempt to assure that things don’t get out of hand. While having 1,300 or so listings at the time of launch is a good start, the size of the market and the number of listings on blogs will not compare to eBay or Craigslist any time soon (though Edgeio can also use other directories as sources as well, making it a classifieds meta-site).</p>, <p>In the long-term there is a fantastic opportunity, especially since publishing to the web on your own terms is something that is becoming more and more available to ordinary web users (and with services such as MySpace and MSN spaces the number of users is getting really big). Edgeio is a very open platform, they want others to build applications and use the listing content in other sites and applications. I am sure that regardless of the success of Edgeio that its more traditional competition has had to think about their own policies with providing feeds and other openness measures and I hope that the launch of Edgeio may spur change with other platforms.</p>, <p>Edgeio was founded by <a href=""http://www.teare.com"">Keith Teare</a> (easyNet and Realnames) and <a href=""http://www.crunchnotes.com"">Micheal Arrington</a> (Techcrunch) along with the founding technical team consisting of Matt Kaufman (There and Realnames) and Vidar Hokstad (Yahoo! Europe). Edgeio have raised $1.5M in angel capital from a large list of investors with names such as Louis Monier, Frank Caufield, Auren Hoffman, the RSS Investors Fund, <a href=""http://blog.softtechvc.com/"">Jeff Clavier</a>, Ron Conway and Michael Tanne.</p>, <p>Edgeio will need to overcome those barriers, as well as have more and more sellers adopt the model that they are pushing (ie. The ‘listing’ tag). They are going the right way about it, with a very nice interface and some very cool features, along with the will to make this happen and the right people to see it through.

Until now bloggers could not get this information – analytics services  like <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/tag/Measure-Map/"">MeasureMap</a> and <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/02/21/blogbeat-rocking-the-blog-stat-beats/"">BlogBeat</a> give us good insight into what’s being done on the actual site, but unless a click through to the site occurs from a feed, there was little or no information on what was actually being read off site. FeedBurner’s new stats go a long way toward mitigating this problem.</p>, <p>They are also showing what they call “uncommon” sources which allow bloggers to see where their feeds are being read and re-used beyond the standard RSS readers like Rojo and Bloglines, and new tools for podcasters to track downloads.</p>, <p>Dick summarized all of the new features in his email:</p>, <p>The new features are:</p>, <p> a) Uncommon uses. We track 200k feeds and so we see everywhere feeds are used regularly. When we see someplace a feed is referenced or clicked that we don’t recognize as a common reference, we highlight it here in the dashboard and on the detailed uncommon uses page. Could be a cool little newfilter somebody wrote, could be a blog somebody assembled from feeds, could be a cool little web-based aggregator we’ve never heard of, could be blog spam. Whatever it is, we’ve found that publishers love to see these unique uses and references and that it’s very helpful to have something like feedburner that can leverage a broad base of common references to point out the uncommon ones. You can then “whitelist” or “hide” references you already know about (note that your own site will be an uncommon reference, whitelist that one right away), and you’ll never be Alerted to whitelisted domains on your dashboard again.</p>, <p> b) Better integration of item stats and feed stats, better clickthrough to items for more details</p>, <p> c) Reach! Now we start to give you an idea of what percent of your subscribers actually looked at or clicked on one of your items today. This is step one. We will spend a lot more time on reach based on how people react to v1 here. We know there’s much more to dive into on this.</p>, <p> d) Historical reach and subscription from the dashboard…..you can now click back through the days on the dashboard chart to see reach and item popularity by day.</p>, <p> e) Podcasters – better feed level download tracking. In addition to subscribers we now identify the number of people that actually downloaded a particular podcast. This will get even more robust in the future as we provide download numbers from the podcast on the site and sum that with the feed based downloads. This release is feed based downloads only.</p>, <p>This comes on the heals of FeedBurner’s <a href=""http://www.burningdoor.com/feedburner/archives/001687.html"">2 year birthday</a> and announced funding from <a href=""http://www.unionsquareventures.com/2006/02/feedburner.html"">Union Square Ventures</a> earlier this month.

Maxthon: the browser that rocks,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""Maxthon"" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/maxthon_logo.gif"" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.maxthon.com"">Maxthon</a> is in my view the best alternative to Internet Explorer. Firefox and Opera are doing a great job (both in product and buzz) but they just don’t catch up with Maxthon.</p>, <p>Founded by the very young and brilliant Jeff Chen in 2003 in China (under MyIE name), Maxthon became very quickly popular in Asia (awarded last year in <a href=""http://www.redherring.com/rhasia100/Nomination.html"">Red Herring Asia </a>) and all over the world. The big difference with other browsers is that Maxthon is based on IE code which makes the software very familiar from the beginning but with a few twists. Unlike IE, it is very fast, safe and very stable and brings a unique browsing experience as it enables you to customize nearly any part of the software. Like Firefox,  Maxthon brings tab browsing, embedded RSS and podcast reader (a <a href=""http://net.typepad.com/maxthon_blog/2006/02/i_love_the_podc.html"">very cool one</a>), search bar… but without necessity to add any extension.</p>, <p>The key strength of Maxthon is that it enables you to customize totally your browsing experience with extreme simplicity. A few examples: URL shortcuts. Instead of typing a URL or clicking a bookmark (ok it takes less than 2 sec but still) you can set up a URL alias (“2” for instance) and type directly in the URL bar which will lead you to the URL of your choice (eg: your flickr page). You can change easily skins, a wide choice is offered. Mouse gesture is also great just like super drag and drop features to save an image or initiate a search on a given word within web page.</p>, <p>There are <a href=""http://www.maxthon.com/features.htm"">too many features</a> to cover them all here. I believe you should play with it first (tip: use your right click nearly anywhere). All those I know who tried it loved it. It sounds maybe too much like FireFox in some way but again it is not. To better understand the pros of Maxthon read this article from <a href=""http://internetweek.cmp.com/179101486"">Internet Week</a>.</p>, <p>We could get exclusive intial screenshots and news on next 2.0 version to come up soon. I believe Maxthon will become even better. They are building right now a better interface with greater possibilities of customization, data sharing, multi window browsing, cool blogging features and many other things kept secret for now.</p>, <p><img alt=""Maxthon"" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/maxthon_pane.png""/></p>, <p><img alt=""Maxthon"" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/max2-1.jpg""/></p>, <p>Great quality leads to great popularity and Maxthon just passed <strong>50 million downloads </strong>(announced on <a href=""http://net.typepad.com/maxthon_blog/2006/02/maxthon_passes_.html"">their blog </a>but also on <a href=""http://daily.gigaom.com/2006/02/27/maxthon-browser-passed-50-million-downloads/"">Daily OM</a>)</p>, <p><img alt=""Maxthon"" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/maxthon_50m.jpg""/></p>, <p>Beyond a good product and critical size,  Maxthon has great assets for success: first a great team including <a href=""http://net.typepad.com/"">Netanel Jacobsson </a>as SVP Bus.

They call it an “ebay for services”, allowing people to charge for advice over the phone (and by email – more on that below).</p>, <p><img class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/ether1.jpg""/></p>, <p>Service providers set up an account by providing some personal information and a phone number that they would like to be called at. Any service that can be provided over the phone is a perfect match for Ether. “Sellers” set their price, from free to anything (on a per minute or per hour basis). They can tell Ether the hours they are willing to take calls. Every seller is issued a toll free phone number (with a dedicated extension), which forwards to their phone.</p>, <p><img class=""shot2"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/ether2.jpg"" style=""float:right;""/>Buyers can search through providers, see prices, feedback, etc. Once they agree to terms, they can place the call. Sellers only get calls once a Buyer has paid the fee and agreed to the terms.</p>, <p>Ether takes a flat 15% of fees for its trouble. They cover long distance charges and credit card processing fees out of this 15%.</p>, <p>And the fun doesn’t stop there. Sellers can also sell any type of digital content through Ether as well. The buyer is able to access the content only after paying the agreed upon fee. This content can be emailed out to people, or accessed via a link/badge that can be placed on a website.</p>, <p>The combination of phone advice, plus the ability to charge for digital content, opens up all kinds of possibilities. At first glance, I saw this as a kind of Web 2.0 <a href=""http://www.elance.com/"">elance</a>…but after testing out the service its clear that it goes way beyond what previous services in this space did. Ether brings people together directly via calls or email, and sets up a great billing mechanism in between the parties. I expect Ether to ramp quickly towards success, and it will be extremely hard for competitors to enter the space given the capital intensive infrastructure needed to do something like this.</p>, <p>See <a href=""http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/03/01/ether-to-open-up-services/"">Robert Scoble</a> on Ether as well, who met with the team last week and asks “Anyone have any ideas of how they’d use Ether?”</p>, <p><img class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/ether31.jpg""/></p>, <p><img class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/ether41.jpg""/></p>]"

Force.com + Google App Engine = Cloud Relationship Management,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""shot"" src=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/salesforcegoogle.jpg""/></p>, <p>Salesforce and Google have extended their strategic partnership with Force.com for Google App Engine, essentially bridging the two cloud-based application development environments.  App Engine applications, which are typically consumer apps, will be able to access enterprise data and services via the Force.com API.</p>, <p>The integration consists of a Python library, example code, and testing harness that allows App Engine apps to read and write to Force.com.  As an example, Salesforce executives demoed for me a hybrid application that combined a game interface built on App Engine that allowed visitors to Harrah’s website the ability to win additional points and upgrade their experience in the actual Las Vegas casino.</p>, <p>Only a month ago Salesforce <a href=""http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/11/02/forcecom-sets-its-sites-on-microsoft/"">announced a new Sites service</a>, which allows Force.com customers to host not only internal Salesforce and App Force applications but the public-facing Web site. The App Engine integration combines consumer-facing apps built and hosted on the Google cloud with line-of-business data stored, accessed, and hosted on the Salesforce cloud. In essence, it’s the first federation between two clouds – or as CEO Marc Benioff might label it, CaaS, or Clouds as a Service.</p>, <p>This iterative approach to connecting cloud services reflects Google’s aggressive move from dominating search to owning greater and greater amounts of consumer interactions on the desktop. As Google extends its leverage to its own browser and perhaps an Internet operating system, the company will have captured user data at a personal level, released it via integrated APIs to corporate information and customer relationship management systems, and harvested a much fuller picture of transactions from initial search to final purchase.</p>, <p>Salesforce continues to follow the logic of its ongoing relationship with Google, which began with joint philanthropic efforts in 2003 and has accelerated with hooks to AdWords, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2008/04/13/more-details-on-the-google-salesforce-enemy-of-my-enemy-is-my-friend-alliance/"">Google Apps</a>, OpenSocial, and the <a href=""http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/06/23/liveblog-salesforce-and-google-announcement/"">Google Data APIs</a>. Google is not the only beneficiary of Salesforce’ attention; <a href=""http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/11/03/salesforce-meets-facebook-connect/"">Facebook announced similar hooks</a> between the two services at the recent DreamForce developer conference.</p>, <p>Interestingly, Facebook’s scaling of its social graph via Facebook Connect and scoped access to Facebook videos based on Facebook friend relationships mirrors App Engine access to Salesforce data, workflow, and application logic behind the enterprise firewall. While Microsoft moves to boil the WIndows ocean with Azure and Office online services from the enterprise outward, Salesforce and Google are moving bottom up from the consumer. It’s the new CRM – Cloud Relationship Management.</p>]"

Speaking at Sign On San Diego, Eisner described these episodes as “sort of halfway between radio and video,” essentially meaning that the third screen format will mean lots of close-ups and an emphasis on dialog.

Zune is Here,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""right"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/image003_low.jpg""/></p>, <p>Microsoft today announced a bunch of official information on Zune. The first Zune branded digital media player will hold 30GB and will be available for the holidays. It features wireless connectivity, a built-in FM turner and a 3-inch screen. The big feature is its ability to share music wirelessly with the ingeniously named Zune-to-Zune sharing. It feels to me like Microsoft is putting a lot of eggs in the wireless sharing basket. I’m not convinced there is really that much demand for the feature, but I suppose we shall see.</p>, <p>More info after ze drop.<span id=""more-919""></span></p>, <p>Some cool information was also stated about the Zune Marketplace. Users can download tracks individually or they can buy a Zune Pass that allows one to download as many tracks as desired for one flat fee. In addition to that, the Zune device will come preloaded with tracks from labels such as: DTS, EMI Music’s Astralwerks Records and Virgin Records, Ninja Tune, Playlouderecordings, Quango Music Group, Sub Pop Records, and V2/Artemis. I like this move. Not only does it feature some smaller indie labels, but I like the fact that users will have music immediately.</p>, <p><strong>Edit</strong>: Just got off the phone with Microsoft and we’ve got a bit more information. Microsoft sees this as an opportunity to build a community that celebrates and shares music. The focal point of this ambition is, of course, Zune’s wireless connectivity. It features 802.11 b/g wireless that allows users to send music to one another. You can actually send a file to another Zune user, but it will only be playable three times or stored for three days, whichever comes first. This applies to all songs. Even if you decide to make an MP3 of your cat mewling, even though it’s your own intellectual property (or maybe your cat’s if you’re carrying a PETA card), it’s still restricted by the Zune Rule of Three. It’s not perfect, but I guess it’s better than just being able to stream tracks.</p>, <p>The Zune will include in the box earphones, a protective sleeve, a USB sync cable and a sticker (oh boy!).There is currently no price or release date, but Microsoft promises competitive pricing and availability by the holidays.</p>]"

Microsoft's Dan'l Lewin talks BizSpark at LeWeb,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a class=""shot2"" href=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/lewin.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-924"" height=""289"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/lewin.jpg"" title=""lewin"" width=""394""/></a>Anything Microsoft does is looked at through a prism cut from the glass of the company that Gates built. The days of the anti-trust trial, Hailstorm, and the browser wars may seem far away, but not for the Netscapes and Novells who foundered in the face of the Windows and Office steamroller. Yet refugees of those wars have reinvented themselves in the new world of the social network, most poignantly represented by Eric Schmidt and his third-times-the-charm Google.</p>, <p>In the context of Google, a reinvigorated Apple, and the rise of cloud computing, Microsoft has figured out they have just as much of right to be reborn. Ray Ozzie’s tenure at the company has been a kind of stealth startup transformation applied to the entrenched duchies of the old company, and it’s bearing fruit in new language not often heard from Redmond: open, cross-platform, Mesh, Silverlight, Azure.</p>, <p>Opening the LeWeb 08 conference in Paris, Dan’l Lewin, Microsoft Corporate Vice President for Strategic and Emerging Business Development presented this new face in a conversation with me embedded below. I’ll admit I like Dan’l and the new Microsoft, especially when viewed in the context of a troubled world economy and its effect on the shortened runways of the Silicon Valley startup community. There’s a sense that even with its plentiful assets, Microsoft and Lewin understand they have to come more than half way to gain a necessary trust.</p>, <p>Lewin heads the BizSpark initiative, designed to give startups a jumpstart with access to Microsoft servers, tools, and services for three years with the caveat that, wait for it, they are making less than $1 million in revenue per year and are willing to cut Microsoft a check for $100 at the end of the term. I’ll let Lewin explain the rest as he did on the stage yesterday, but stay tuned for the message behind the pitch – that Microsoft is ready to compete not just with itself but others for the hearts and minds of the Net crowd. Only when you compare carefully the various value propositions do you begin to see how far Microsoft has come – and how far they will have to continue to go.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/930292"">http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/930292</a></p>]"

Not only is this service free, but PodServe is also providing a RSS feed for the page (which you can use or not), and PodServe will also provide statistics and other tools to assist the publisher. Comments/reviews are also enabled on each site.</p>, <p>If you are a podcaster looking for a free place to host your files, PodServe is an excellent choice.</p>, <p><strong>Second</strong>, PodServe also allows “social podcasts”. A channel can be created that allows a number of podcasters to submit files, and all will be included in the feed.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>The <strong>third</strong> notable feature is really interesting. Users can create full public podcast channels that anyone can add their content to. Two great examples are Brian’s <a href=""http://pod-serve.com/podcasts/show/naked-coversations-discussion"">Naked Conversations Discussion</a> (podcasts discussing Robert Scoble and Shel Israel’s new book) and Alexander Muse’s <a href=""http://pod-serve.com/podcasts/show/elevator-pitch-podcast"">Elevator Pitch Podcast</a>, which is a podcast that any company can use to submit an elevator pitch.

Snaptune: Remember recording radio to cassette?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://snaptune.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>I was introduced to Bill Baxter, one of the founders of new startup <a href=""http://snaptune.com/"">SnapTune</a>, today. The company will be launching this week. With a little user configuration, Snaptune will automatically downloads songs and other content directly from an FM radio to your computer, and add meta data from Amazon and other sources.</p>, <p>Setup requires a download (PC only right now, so I had to break out my old laptop), and connecting a FM receiver to the PC (including just about any FM radio via line in). The service also shows song information, including information obtained from Amazon.com’s web service.</p>, <p>Snaptune One works with most FM tuner cards and USB FM devices, or you can simply connect an FM radio up to line-in on your PC to get started.  For less than $2 for a simple cable you can get started with Snaptune today and start discovering an endless supply of new music.  With a USB FM tuner you get the added benefit that Snaptune can tune to different stations for you according to a schedule you define.</p>, <p>Snaptune One works with almost any radio station anywhere in the world. FM radio goes in, individual songs come out, it’s that simple!</p>, <p>Snaptune One also shows you information about each song, the albums that contain it, other albums by the same band, how popular it is on the radio, how new it is, whether it’s going up or down in popularity, and detailed reviews for the albums from Amazon.com.  With a couple of clicks of the mouse you can add any album you like into your Amazon.com shopping cart.</p>, <p>According to Bill, Snaptune is able to find complete songs and other content in audio streams by using “advanced signal processing and search techniques”. When I pressed him for more details, he wouldn’t budge, citing IP protection concerns (fair enough), but added “it just works, try it!”</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Well, I wasn’t able to try it because I couldn’t find a USB FM receiver for my computer today (Fry’s for some crazy reason doesn’t carry them). I’ll be doing more “research” tomorrow though. Bill tells me CompUSA carries a bunch of different brands.</p>, <p>Based on one of the <a href=""http://snaptune.com/snaptuneone/images/songs.JPG"">screen shots</a>, though, one thing is certain – Snaptune will do a good job pulling in meta data about the songs from Amazon and other sources (including user created data).</p>, <p>Once the hardware is setup and the client installed, you simply set your favorite radio stations (and if you like, specific times of broadcasts), and Snaptune will automatically download the music and metadata for you. This is a music discovery service – like Pandora, you tell it something about what you like (in this case, certain stations and times), and Snaptune selects music for you based on that information. While you can use existing software to record FM on your computer, Snaptune does all of the hard work for you and guarantees full audio of the songs, etc.</p>, <p>For free accounts, you can move up to 20 songs to your hard drive in MP3 or WMA format.

V CAST Names that Tune,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""vcast.jpg"" class=""right"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/vcast.jpg""/>What do you do when you hear a song you like, but have no idea who it is by? Well, the old school way was to sing it at the record store, but that is as sorry as trying out for <em>American Idol</em>. In the 21st century you have ways to name that tune without having to belt into song. The Verizon Wireless V CAST Song ID will allow you hear a song, hold the phone toward the music and then capture a sample of the music. From this V Cast Song ID will identify the music and even allow you to purchase a matching full-track song, ringtone or ringback tone. So next time you’re in a club or just listening to the radio you can use this feature to name the song, which sure beats asking someone, “do you know who this is?”</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.verizonwireless.com"">Verizon Wireless</a></p>]"
Fastap: Keypad Revolution,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/DSC00225.jpg""/></p>, <p>
The 12 button keypad is a 50 year old design that remains on 95% of phones sold today. It serves as a barrier to discovery, access and use of wireless devices and mobile data services.
</p>, <p>Fastap keypad technology is a new keypad design that simplifies the way users can use their cell phones. The works like this: There are little black buttons that rise up from the keypad for letters or one button features, and underneath those little black buttons are the regular numbers we see and use every day. The techonlogy “knows” when you are trying to hit a letter or number and decides for you. If you’re trying to dial “1” and your finger hits the letter “A” and “1”, the phone will automatically decide that you’re trying to hit the number. If you hit two letters at the same time, the number inbetween the letters will be selected.</p>, <p>We got to put our hands on this new technology at CTIA Wireless and we were nothing short of impressed. The keypad worked exactly as Fastap told us it would. It was just as easy to write an email to someone as it was on a full QWERTY keyboard! This is a great idea to bring users to actually use data services on a normal cell phone.  The technology can be implemented on any type of phone and as far as we can tell, it will. I’ve definitely been out of the candy bar and flip phone market for quite a while, just because data services on these phones can get really frustrating. If you’ve been waiting for an answer to that frustartion, here it is.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.digitwireless.com/"">Fastap</a> [product page]</p>]"

While the launch of broadcast mobile TV was planned to kick off this autumn in time for the Rugby World Cup, a conflict between French mobile operators and broadcasters has led to a delay. Recent complications, which have resulted in a stand still over the business model will likely push back the launch of DVB-H services in France until at least next summer.

Google Drive: What we know so far,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>We have all the ingredients for a great story: dramatic predictions of Google taking over the world, secret disclosures of a new stealth product at a Google analyst meeting, outing of the story by bloggers, and subsequent purging of the public data by Google to keep things hidden from the public and competitors.</p>, <p>Here’s what we know so far:</p>, <p>In the spring of 2004 Robin Sloan and Matt Thompson presented the ominous Epic 2014 (now renamed Epic 2015) that ultimately predicts that Google will force the New York Times to shut down. In the movie, they also predict that Google will launch something called “Google Grid”: <em>“…a universal platform offering an unlimited amount of space and bandwidth that can be used to store anything. It allows users to manage their information two ways: store it privately or publish it to the entire grid.”</em> <a href=""http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/epic"">See the movie here</a>.</p>, <p>Robin and Matt’s Google Grid prediction seems to be well on its way to becoming reality. On March 2, 2006 (a few days ago), Google hosted an analyst day and presented a wide range of information on new products and strategies. Among the information was a description of the upcoming “Google Drive”, a place for users to store 100% of their data online.</p>, <p>On page 19 of the presentation, Google stated the following:</p>, <p><strong>Store 100% of User Data</strong></p>, <p>With infinite storage, we can house all user files, including: emails, web history, pictures, bookmarks, etc and make it accessible from anywhere (any device, any platform, etc).</p>, <p>We already have efforts in this direction in terms of GDrive, GDS, Lighthouse, but all of them face bandwidth and storage constraints today. For example: Firefox team is working on server side stored state but they want to store only URLs rather than complete web pages for storage reasons. This theme will help us make the client less important (thin client, thick server model) which suits our strength vis-a-vis Microsoft and is also of great value to the user.</p>, <p>As we move toward the “Store 100%” reality, the online copy of your data will become your Golden Copy and your local-machine copy serves more like a cache. An important implication of this theme is that we can make your online copy more secure than it would be on your own machine.</p>, <p>Another important implication of this theme is that storing 100% of a user’s data makes each piece of data more valuable because it can be access across applications. For example: a user’s Orkut profile has more value when it’s accessible from Gmail (as addressbook), Lighthouse (as access list), etc.</p>, <p>These slides were also made publicly available.</p>, <p>However, the slides discussing Google Drive were quickly taken down by Google and replaced with a sterilized version after entrepreneur and blogger Greg Linden noted the Google Drive information and <a href=""http://glinden.blogspot.com/2006/03/in-world-with-infinite-storage.html"">blogged about it</a>.</p>, <p>Greg did not retain a copy of the original, but readers of his blog did and posted the original content in the <a href=""http://glinden.blogspot.com/2006/03/in-world-with-infinite-storage.html#comments"">comments</a> to Greg’s post.</p>, <p>At this point, all we know is that Google is already developing Google Drive, an online storage service that will be designed to store all of our data and make it accessible from various devices. No word on pricing. As to timing, Google is concerned with storage and bandwidth constraints that exist today, and so this may still be far into the future.</p>, <p>Even so, the thought of Google entereing the market must give the <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/01/31/the-online-storage-gang/"">online storage startup gang</a> a shudder.</p>, <p>A final thought on Google Drive: Information was clearly purged from analyst materials (unless this is an elaborate hoax by Greg and his readers), meaning we have selective disclosure of this information. Some people received it but it is not generally available to the public. I don’t like this. <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/michaelarrington/91442916/"">In fact, I think it’s Gevil</a>. Now that some people know about it, Google should put it (back) up on the web.</p>]"

Harvard's Nano Antenna Could Create 3TB CDs,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""right"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/17504-09150620Greene20nano_antenna.jpg""/></p>, <p>A research team over at Harvard University has developed a nano antenna that can be mounted on a regular off-the-shelf laser so that data can be written onto media at a much greater rate. In theory, this would mean that even the soon-to-be-obsolete CD could have over 3TB written onto it. The device is essentially a couple of gold-coated nano rods. When light from the laser hits the rods, it applies a force to the electrons in the gold, nudging them out of place. It gets more technical and more cool sounding from there, and I’m no scientist. But, the team seems quite optimistic. Right now,their efforts are on figuring out low-cost manufacturing for such a device.

Now You Can Track Customers Who Bypass Mobile browsing for Applications: Omniture releases iPhone Analytics SDK,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" class=""alignleft"" height=""68"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/omniture.png"" style=""margin:10px;"" title=""omniture logo"" width=""185""/>Yesterday, <a href=""http://www.omniture.com/"">Omniture</a> released a real-time iPhone analytics SDK. (Main TechCrunch <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2008/12/16/omniture-brings-real-time-analytics-to-iphone-applications/"">coverage here</a>.)</p>, <p>On the innovation side, this is a big deal. The iPhone market shows that consumers, frustrated with the suboptimal mobile browsing experience, prefer actual applications. Example: I use the iPhone <a href=""http://www.rememberthemilk.com/"">Remember the Milk</a> application every day, and can’t imagine using a mobile website.</p>, <p>As consumers bypass websites, it leaves marketers without a way to capture sales-cycle metrics. (A personal favorite: <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version"">Startup Metrics for Pirates</a>.) Building metrics into applications is a no brainer–expect that trend to accelerate.</p>, <p>But before you get excited, realize this particular SDK is useless without an Omniture account. And since Omniture’s primary customers include giants like Microsoft, eBay, and Disney, it’s too expensive for most iPhone developers.</p>, <p>Yesterday, I talked with Matt Langie, Omniture’s Senior Director of Product Marketing.

"Exclusive: Salesforce Business Mashups, New Developer Community","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""appexchange logo"" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/appexchange-logo.jpg""/></p>, <p>I have had the privilege of getting an exclusive look at the new developer community and toolkits that <a href=""http://www.salesforce.com"">Salesforce </a>will be launching at the <a href=""http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/"">eTech </a>conference tomorrow. Salesforce have been on the cutting edge of what we now call Web 2.0 in the business space for years. They were trying to swing mindset towards software as a service and the web as a platform long before we had the terms that we use today to describe these technologies and ideas. Salesforce has grown to become much more than just a CRM application and is now a platform for business collaboration and communication on the web – allowing developers to build applications on their platform and giving their 399,000-strong customer base access to these applications.</p>, <p>The best indication of the growth of Salesforce as a platform has been that now over 40% of requests to Salesforce web servers are SOAP requests to their API. <a href=""http://www.appexchange.com"">AppExchange</a> is the application platform at Salesforce and today its library of applications has over 160 applications listed within it, all of which are available to Salesforce customers. At eTech Salesforce plan to announce the launch of their new developer community – the <a href=""http://developer.appexchange.com"">AppExchange Developer Network</a>, which provides developers with the community, tools and resources to let them build applications for AppExchange. Salesforce will also be announcing the availability of toolkits for both <a href=""http://www.salesforce.com/developer/projects_toolkits.jsp#php"">PHP </a>(supporting the native SOAP libraries in PHP5 – developed in collaboration with <a href=""http://www.zend.org"">Zend</a>) and something that is very exciting, a <a href=""http://www.rubyonrails.org"">RubyOnRails </a>toolkit called <a href=""http://activesfdc.rubyforge.org/"">ActiveSalesforce</a>.</p>, <p>Salesforce refers to what we know as Web 2.0 in the consumer space as ‘The Business Web’ in the business space. The technologies and ideas behind Web 2.0 such as Ajax, SOAP, Software as a service etc. all started out in the business space and their breakout into the consumer space resulted in the Web 2.0 we know today. While businesses and products such as the early Salesforce were the instigators and drivers popularizing the technology the growth of the consumer Web 2.0 resulted in the business space being forgotten. The purpose of the AppExchange Developer Network is to make it much easier for developers of mashups and other applications to apply their skills in the business space and to have their solutions showcased to the large user base that Salesforce has.</p>, <p>I have previously developed applications as well as client libraries that integrated with Salesforce, back with the first release of their API in 2002, and was amazed at how far both the technology and the community had developed since then. Today as a developer you can go to the developer network to signup for a free developer edition account, download all the development tools you will need and learn everything there is to know about building apps for Salesforce using the plethora of resources and the community they have on hand. The methodology behind AppExchange for a developer is:</p>, <p>There are a number of possibilities, for instance a expense report application could integrate with PayPal to settle payments with employees and send them back notifications (just one idea). Salesforce offers all this to developers and asks for nothing in the form of a payment, or even a revenue share. There are a number of successful applications in AppExchange right now, and a number of businesses who have products exclusively on AppExchange and do very well from it. An example is a company called <a href=""http://www.dreamfactory.com"">DreamFactory </a>which was founded by Bill Appleton. DreamFactory has released a number of products for AppExchange such as <a href=""http://www.dreamfactory.com/dreamteam/index.html"">DreamTeam</a>, a project management application. At Techcrunch each week we see so many new products each week that are jumping into very crowded spaces (such as online calendaring, and our favorite, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/02/28/foldcom-why/"">Ajax desktops</a>) that have no clear revenue model. More of these companies should consider the business space and what Salesforce has to offer developers with AppExchange. The cost of getting your product onto the platform is zero, and the huge amount of resources makes it very simple to do.</p>, <p>I also got an exclusive look at some of the new applications in AppExchange that will be released shortly. These are all mashups of services that we know now with Salesforce. The first example was the <a href=""http://maps.google.com"">Google Maps</a> mashup, which displays on a map the location of your leads or contacts. This mashup was developed using the awesome <a href=""http://forums.sforce.com/sforce/board?board.id=ajax_toolkit"">Ajax toolkit</a> which allows the application to be hosted in the client – meaning the developer of the mashup doesn’t need a host server. The other exciting mashup was Salesforce integration into <a href=""http://www.skype.com"">Skype</a>. What the user does is selects who they would like to call or invite into a conference then press a ‘call’ button and it will dial out over Skype to these people and setup a conference. You can mix-up Skye usernames that you have stored against a contact with ordinary phone numbers and it will take care of it.</p>, <p>Another mashup that I saw was the integration of Salesforce with the online word processor <a href=""http://www.writely.com"">Writely</a>. When this is launched Salesforce customers who store their documents on Salesforce will be able to open them with Writely and save them straight back to Salesforce again. Yet another mashup which again was very simple and effective was integration with the <a href=""http://www.adobe.com"">Adobe </a>online PDF generator, allowing you to create PDF’s from sources within Salesforce and having them save back to your account.</p>, <p>These mashups all had one thing in common – they are an elegant combination of two great services that combined prove to be a very effective solution to common problems for business users. I could spend a lot of time talking about AppExchange and Salesforce and I don’t feel that a single post can do them justice. What I do hope is that with the announcement of the new AppExchange Developer Network and new toolkits that make it very simple to write apps, that more and more developers will consider joining the community at Salesforce and developing not only products but businesses on top of Salesforce. I know I look forward to reviewing more applications in the future that are built in Salesforce.</p>, <p><img alt=""Salesforce Appexchange"" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/salesforce-appexchange.jpg""/></p>, <p><img alt=""Salesforce Skype"" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/salesforce-skype.jpg""/></p>, <p><img alt=""Salesforce Writely"" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/salesforce-writely.jpg""/></p>]"

SixApart Moves Into Business Space,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""sixapart"" class=""shot2"" height=""71"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/sixapart.jpg"" width=""128""/></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.sixapart.com"">SixApart</a>, the creators of popular blogging platforms <a href=""http://www.typepad.com"">TypePad </a>and <a href=""http://www.movabletype.com"">MovableType </a>will be releasing a set of new features and services for their products directly aimed at the growing business market for blog software. Currently there are a large number of corporations already publishing blogs using SixApart software and the latest releases are part of a broader strategy to better support and to grow this enterprise customer base.</p>, <p>The first software release to spin out of the new strategy will be Typepad Business Class, a new TypePad edition that will be suited for companies with high-traffic sites who wish to setup a blog or multiple blogs to communicate with their audience. TypePad Business Class will be launching today and will contain a number of technical enhancements over classic TypePad that are tailored for enterprise requirements. For starters there will be an improved permissions structure with up to 4 levels of administrator access which can be used to control access to all aspects of the blog (such as ability to post, comment management, design editing). They have also made it easy to setup additional blogs and to control all aspects of the corporations blog design so that it can be tailored to match their corporate identity. The storage allocation with the Business Class service will be 4GB while bandwidth allocation will be 40GB per month with the price coming in at $89.95 per month. Other plans with more storage and bandwidth allocation will also be available at higher prices.</p>, <p>SixApart will also accompany the technical improvements with service level agreements that will guarantee a certain level of uptime, an essential requirement if they wish to attract the big corporations onto their platform. The SLA being offered only guarantees 99% uptime (which is still 4 days a year of downtime, that isn’t guaranteed) but it is the first such guarantee from a blogging provider. SixApart will also be holding seminars to help companies start blogging, the first of these is the <a href=""http://blogbusinesssummit.com."">Blog Business Summit</a> on March 16, 2006 in Los Angeles.</p>, <p>Also as part of the new business strategy MovableType will be getting a makeover with some enterprise features such as integration with LDAP directories and other authentication services, better anti-spam protection, Oracle database support (amongst others) and customizable email support. The business-grade MovableType doesn’t have a launch date or a price yet but it is currently in beta in Japan and should be out soon.</p>, <p>It seems that every day you hear about or see news of yet another company that has started a blog (or blogs) so capturing this interest and growth with targeted products is a very smart strategy from SixApart. At the moment these businesses who wish to blog are either setting it up themselves or engaging outside consultants, so now they have a company to go to which has a solid market share in the consumer space and a good reputation. I believe it is only a matter of time before <a href=""http://www.wordpress.com"">WordPress </a>and others catch onto this market and release their own services targeted at businesses.</p>]"

"Microsoft Live Clipboard – ""Wiring the Web""","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Ray Ozzie, Microsoft’s CTO, had a thought for a new service about a month ago. Today, he launched it at <a href=""http://spaces.msn.com/rayozzie/blog/cns!FB3017FBB9B2E142!285.entry"">eTech</a> and through Dave Winer’s <a href=""http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/03/07/ray-ozzies-clipboard-for-the-web/"">Scripting News</a>.</p>, <p>The core idea is a new open standard, called Live Clipboard, which allows the copy and pasting of data, including dynamic, updating data, across and between web applications and desktop applications. Microformats for things like calendar entries, contact information, etc. will use common clipboard data formats. Ray wrote on his <a href=""http://spaces.msn.com/rayozzie/blog/cns!FB3017FBB9B2E142!285.entry"">blog</a> today:</p>, <p>Simply stated, I’d like to <strong>extend the clipboard user model to the web.</strong></p>, <p>A few weeks ago, I approached my brother Jack – who leads a Concept Development team in my group at Microsoft – and visually sketched out and storyboarded some end-to-end user scenarios that I wanted to try to accomplish.  The scenarios were all centered on this new clipboard user model.</p>, <p>The team took me up on the challenge, and in a few short weeks had accomplished all of the scenarios, and more.  And they did it using techniques that are incredibly simple, and which work securely and are browser independent.</p>, <p>Today at O’Reilly’s Emerging Technology Conference, I’m sharing this new concept – through a brief demo and through hallway discussion.</p>, <p>I call this new concept <strong>Live Clipboard</strong>, because we view “live” efforts as those providing users with seamless end-to-end scenarios that “just work” by weaving together the best of software and the best of services.</p>, <p>The Concept Development team has created a <a href=""http://spaces.msn.com/editorial/rayozzie/demo/liveclip/screencast/liveclipdemo.html"">screencast of a Live Clipboard demo</a>, and a <a href=""http://spaces.msn.com/editorial/rayozzie/demo/liveclip/liveclipsample/clipboardexample.html"">simple web page-based demo</a> that you can play with.

You will tell lala what music you have. Other members can request it from you, and you send it directly to them using a postage-prepaid envelope supplied by lala.

Exclusive Screenshots: Google Calendar,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/04/12/google-calendar-is-live/"">Google Calendar is live</a>.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.google.com/cl2""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>I am now in possession of screenshots from Google’s long delayed new Ajax calendar application, which will be called “CL2” (the CL2 login screen <a href=""http://www.google.com/cl2"">is here</a>). It was only a matter of time before someone broke down and leaked these – as far as I know these screen shots are the first on the public web. <a href=""http://blogs.zdnet.com/Google/index.php?p=122"">Previous ones</a> were almost certainly photoshopped fakes. These are real.</p>, <p>Om Malik <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2006/02/26/google-calendar-some-details/"">also recently posted</a> with some additional details and has been trying to track down more information. Now we have it.</p>, <p>Here is the default view of Google’s new CL2 Calendar:</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""http://static.flickr.com/44/110404234_2e2b056534.jpg?v=0""/></p>, <p>There have been leaks before today, however. Rumor has it that one of the beta testers provided credentials to Yahoo…although Yahoo notified Google (after a thorough review of the product I suppose).</p>, <p>The closed beta is ongoing with about 200 participants – people involved are not allowed to invite outsiders to see the calendar and are under strict rules not to share any details with outsiders. Based on feedback I am getting, CL2 is a long way away from launch.</p>, <p><strong>About CL2</strong></p>, <p>CL2 makes it easy — even effortless — to keep track of all the events in your life and compare them to what your friends and family have going on in theirs. We’ve designed a calendar that works for you — helping you add events from email, friends, and other public calendars — so you don’t have to spend all your time maintaining your schedule. CL2 even helps you discover new events you might be interested in. We think it’s a great tool for managing your daily schedule, keeping track of what everyone in your family is doing, organizing events for a club or team, or creating public events that you can promote to the world.</p>, <p>CL2 is closely, very closely, integrated with Gmail. It includes now-standard web 2.0 features – Ajax, subscription feeds for integration with iCal and other desktop calendars, event creation, search, sharing, notifications (including SMS) and more.</p>, <p>It’s also clear from the event creation functionality that Google is is going to attempt to aggregate events like eventful and zvents do now. If they combine their event creation feature with a web crawl and parsing of event data (exactly what zvents does), they will be able to create a very large events database. From the CL2 Trusted Tester Guidelines:</p>, <p><strong>Creating Events</strong></p>, <p>You can create events on your calendar in a number of ways.</p>, <p> <strong>Click ‘Create Event.</strong>‘ This brings you to the create event page, where you can enter information about your event.</p>, <p> <strong>Click on Quick Add (or type the letter Q).</strong> Quick Add gives you a text box where you can type all the information about your event in normal English, and we’ll fill out the form for you. We’re pretty excited about this feature, so please let us know how it works for you.</p>, <p> <strong>Drag-to-create.</strong> If you’re looking at the day where you want to create an event on your calendar, just click and drag your mouse from the desired start time to the end time. Once you’ve selected your time range, you can just choose a title for your new event.</p>, <p><strong>Event Pages</strong></p>, <p>Whenever you create an event, we create a web page which you’ll see when you click on the “more details” link on any event. This web page is only visible to you, unless you’ve invited other people to your event or made the event public, in which case you can use the page to share information about the event with people who are attending or the public at large. Note: you don’t have to be a CL2 user to be able to see event pages, so you can use these pages to share information with anyone involved with the event, regardless of what online tools (if any) they use. (Ever wish your favorite local band would learn how to use HTML and publish their calendar? Once we get your feedback and open CL2 to the world you can help them do just that.) </p>, <p>I am not going to publish the full guidelines because there is information included around becoming a tester that I feel is inappropriate for public disclosure.</p>, <p>Overall, CL2 is a very impressive product. The tight integration with Gmail will make that an even more compelling product.

MobileCrunch covered the <a href=""http://mobilecrunch.com/2007/04/25/grandcentral-launches-mobile-version/"">release of their mobile client</a> recently. Today they’ve come out with a useful <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2007/05/28/the-techcrunch-quick-guide-to-grandcentral"">guide</a> to the service. Here’s our summary:</p>, <p>GrandCentral is telephone management service that connects all your phones and adds some new features. To add GrandCentral to your phones, you don’t need to change the phones you already have, you just need to connect them to a new GrandCentral number. With all your phones connected to single GrandCentral number, you’ll have access to new features like central voicemail, call forwarding, call screening, custom greetings, call recording, and spam filtering whenever anyone calls your new number.</p>, <p><strong>Setup</strong></p>, <p>You can get a GrandCentral number by going to their site and entering an area code or state and choosing an available number from their list. Getting a number also sets up an online management account where you can tweak the individual features. To enable GrandCentral on your phones you’ll just have to enter your existing phone numbers into this account and get your contacts to call this new number.</p>, <p><strong>Management</strong></p>, <p>From you management page you can control how your phone responds based on who calls. For instance, you can set up a business group that always rings through to your business line, or a friends group, that always rings all your phones. For each group or individual you can also control the ringtone an greeting they hear. When a call does go through, callers will be asked to state their name if they’re not already on your contact list.</p>, <p><strong>Voicemail</strong></p>, <p>Voicemail is one of GrandCentral’s strongest features. Whenever a call goes to voicemail, you can wait and listen to the message in real time before jumping in, or let it get logged onto your GrandCentral account. All voicemail is stored in a play list on your GrandCentral account, meaning you can access it from any computer. You can also embed messages onto a website. GrandCentral has said that they will soon be releasing a feature that automatically transcribes voicemails into text and will deliver them to you via email or SMS.</p>, <p>GrandCentral also has a mobile version that makes these features available on you mobile. GC also has a click to call button for your website and can forward calls to your Gizmo account.</p>]"
"TiVo: Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""right"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/tivo_1.jpg""/>Well, it had to happen – the company that has ensconced the idea of a DVR in the hearts of millions has lost its good will.</p>, <p>I’ll say it loud and I’ll say it proud – TiVo is the best thing that ever happened to my TV-watching experience. As a parent of an eight-month-old, my evenings are spent curled up on the couch waiting for our little angel to turn eighteen. TiVo has improved TV-watching immensely, allowing us to watch what we want when we want it.</p>, <p>OK. So now I’ve said my peace.<br/>
<span id=""more-974""></span></p>, <p>Unfortunately, TiVo got lazy. I know it’s hard to make an HD DVR. It’s apparently nigh impossible. But TiVo should have had one two years ago. I’m late to the HD game, but plenty of TiVo lovers were <i>pissed</i> as their cable companies offered HD PVRs for free while TiVo capered around like a Faulknerian man-child offering up SD content to the masses. Now that they have a dual tuner superninja PVR, the Series3, people want it. They pre-ordered. They became VIPs. They wiggled their bums and batted their eyelashes and wanted TiVo to love them.</p>, <p>And the result? <a href=""http://www.gearlive.com/index.php/news/article/tivo-lying-to-vip-customers-about-series3-orders-9161104/"">Product not going out on time.</a> False promises. Upset TiVO lovers. A small company that consistently squanders their good will.</p>, <p>The whole story of which I speak is pretty silly: some TiVoers signed up for VIP service which offers 48 hour TiVo shipping and the ability to transfer a lifetime membership to your new HD TiVo. It costs a bit more, but hey, that’s the only way you can transfer your lifetime, $199 membership, right?</p>, <p>So TiVo lovers became VIPs. They placed their orders… and waited. And waited… It’s been 4 days since VIPs were supposed to get their units and Series 3 devices are already in the big box stores <i>and</i> the big boxes let you transfer your lifetime subscription. So people who LOVE TiVo enough to spend more on a Series 3 than an average chump get the shaft, while any Joe can waltz into Best Buy, rock some boxes, and wander out a happy man (or woman).</p>, <p>If you want to make some money, PVR-manufacturers, create something as nice as TiVo, slap in some HD cards, and send it to our homes. Do what you must to keep it inexpensive. And please, please, don’t underestimate your audience.</p>]"

And other European carriers, such as Blyk, a pan-European network, will soon offer free mobile phone calls and text messaging services for free in return for accepting advertising on handsets. This business model is being aimed at the 16 to 24-year old market, one that has less disposable income for making calls, but one that still tends to gab it up considerably.

Why Track will be back – Fred Wilson says so,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a class=""shot2"" href=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/tracks.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-1001"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/tracks.jpg"" title=""tracks""/></a>For those of you new to the Web since the end of May, you can be forgiven for having no clue about why <a href=""http://evhead.com/2007/09/twitter-track.asp"">Track</a> is the shit. Despite months of denial, an open source clone war, a VC-backed API counter offensive, and unknown secret plans to force Twitter into a business model, Twitter still has not returned Track to service.</p>, <p>As a consequence, no one really knows what the world would be like if Track had persisted through the summer and fall. Perhaps Obama would have failed to stop Hillary’s comeback, Hillary would have lost to McCain, and VP-elect Romney would be just a heartbeat from the Residency. Or maybe the economic meltdown would have been stopped by an alert network of Track-enabled researchers bent on cracking the mysteries of derivatives. We’ll never know.</p>, <p>In Paris last week, I spent a few minutes with VC Fred Wilson in the LeWeb speaker room, huddled over a heater next to the bread and water tray. No, that’s not true; there was no bread, and the heater was actually Gabe Rivera’s new MacBook, busy serving up the only outbound connection to the rest of the known world. But Fred, a prominent Twitter investor and a visible Net citizen who actually responds to Tweets about sensitive questions like “Is Track coming back?”, told me Track is definitely coming back.</p>, <p>I can’t quote him verbatim (fingers too numb and light headed from lack of food and wifi) but the gist of what he said was this:</p>, <p>Fred has been consistent about this from the beginning. He is one of those who discovered Track pre-May and loved it, and now is eager for it to return. I didn’t have a chance to grill him further because he had to join a meeting of European startups for a two hour lunch, but I wouldn’t be surprised that since he said Track is up and running inside Twitter that for him it already is back.</p>, <p>Fred has solved his Track problem by owning a chunk of the company, but since Twitter is private we don’t have that option (or the money either.) So I’ve been doing some thinking – made possible by the lack of interruptions from a working Track – about how to accelerate the return of Track to our realtime arsenal.

DabbleDB: Online App Building For Everyone,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.dabbledb.com""><img alt=""dabble"" class=""shot2"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/dabble-logo2.jpg""/></a></p>, <p>Every so often I get asked ‘what is the latest hot app’ and after using <a href=""http://www.dabbledb.com"">DabbleDB </a>I have a new answer to that question. DabbleDB is a platform that allows you to create applications online using a web interface. The sort of applications you would create and then use are what most of us normally hack together in a spreadsheet or using some other database application that is often complex. Example applications that I created in DabbleDB are a contacts list, where I can store, share and categorise my contacts, and also an issue tracking system where I can track bugs and change requests. Other examples on the DabbleDB website are a expense report application, a conference organising app, a scheduling app and a client invoicing application.</p>, <p>It took me 5 minutes to create each of the apps I built, the interface is intuitive and simple to use. Once I created an app I was able to invite other users in with varying levels of permissions (read, write or build) to then enter and/or modify data, or to further customise the app themselves. When creating the application, there are a number of default field types that I can choose from such as a textbox, calendar selection, URL, drop-down selection, a link to another user and many more. At no point did I have to think twice during the building process, I visualised in my head what I needed and a few minutes later it was there on the screen and I was adding entries to it. The app building process is perfect and could not be simpler, if I realise after adding a few entries that I need another field, I just click ‘add field’ and I quickly select what I want and it is there.</p>, <p><img alt=""Dabble Screenshot"" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/dabble3.jpg"" width=""450""/></p>, <p>When I look at all the spreadsheets that I have, I could throw all of them away except for my pure financial spreadsheets and have the rest of that information on DabbleDB within applications that I create myself. It would be a richer experience and give me more options, and I am then able to invite other people in to view this data as well as access it from anywhere. I don’t see the limit to the type of applications that can be built on DabbleDB, from complex project management applications through to the simplest contacts database.</p>, <p>DabbleDB has been developed over the past 12 months by <a href=""http://smallthought.com/andrew/"">Andrew Catton</a> and <a href=""http://smallthought.com/avi/"">Avi Bryant</a> who run an open source and Smalltalk consulting business in Vancouver, Canada (DabbleDB has been developed in Smalltalk using a database system they developed). They expect to be able to launch within a month and currently have thousands of beta users signed up and ready to go. User will be able to try out DabbleDB with a 30-day free trial, and after the trial you will need to pick an account plan which varies based on number of users, number of applications and number of records. Andrew and Avi expect pricing to possibly start at $10 a month or lower and go up beyond $100 per month for enterprises.</p>, <p>Future plans include an Atom API, more rich views for data types (maps, gantt charts, and graphs) and custom forms that you can include on your own website where the information will feed back into your DabbleDB app. The upcoming plan which excited me was pre-built applications which users can install and customise themselves, giving them a start in using DabbleDB.</p>, <p>DabbleDB has great technology, and certainly has a market for this service with not much competition for the type of users they are targeting (ie. People who hack what should be in a database into a spreadsheet) – I am going to build my 2 apps further and add some more and use it in the future to replace the dozens of spreadsheets I have that I can’t do a lot with. These guys have solved some complex problems in building this app and I am confident there will be many personal users as well as businesses who will find that this platform for custom apps will relieve a lot of the pain they have now with spreadsheets.

Podbridge is aiming for an exploding space with podcast growth being huge and advertising growth on the web and in rich media particularly being large.</p>, <p>The service for publishers and advertisers they have recently launched allows them to track not just how many times their podcast has been downloaded, but how many times it has actually been listened to. It does this through software on the client side that the listener must install once the first time they listen to a Podbridge-wrapped podcast. This has long been a long problem for both parties and previously advertising in podcasts has been sold on estimated numbers based on the number of downloads.</p>, <p>How Podbridge works is the publisher wraps their feed in Podbridge code that will allow it to sit in between the publisher and the listener. From the listeners perspective when they download the Podbridge add-in the first time they will be asked a few questions so that advertising can be better tailored to them (how users will react to this I am not sure).</p>, <p>Podbridge can already point their advertisers to a number of big media podcasters which it counts as clients with publishers such as <a href=""http://www.sportsbyline.com/"">Sports Byline USA</a>, <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/downloadtrial/podcast.shtml"">the BBC</a>, <a href=""http://www.military.com"">Military.com</a> and a few others. Podbridge’s new and updated service is hoping to appeal to all podcasters who wish to get some income for their efforts. Podbridge makes it easy for the publisher to signup, as well as allowing them to know a lot more about who their listeners are. The business model is a straight-forward revenue share between Podbridge and the publishers.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.podbridge.com/home/index.php?action=show_advertiser_home"">For advertisers</a>, they are given a portal (much like Adsense) where they can specify to whom they wish to advertise to (demographic and geographic information) as well as other options such as daily budgets. They can then upload an MP3 advertisement and have it pushed out onto the Podbridge network of podcasts.</p>, <p>Podbridge solves some previous problems that publishers and advertisers have had, while at the same time providing an easy way for publishers to integrate intelligent advertising into their podcasts while letting the technology that Podbridge has take care of what advertising to server to who. This space is really heating up and it will be interesting to see if the Podbridge solution will appeal to more and more publishers. A solution like this should mean that I won’t have to listen to as many appeals for donations or Paypal donation buttons on the podcasts that I listen to.</p>]"

There will be a broader launch campaign next month and the site is still in very early days with only a small number of users and small amount of links but I am sure this will grow.</p>, <p>Livelocker can serve a purpose as a place to find the latest funny video’s or any meme’s that you have missed out on, as well as a way to bookmark those that you find interesting. What Livelocker provides over using del.icio.us for the same purpose is the focus on rich media, the ratings and a digg-style ranking system where bookmarking a link counts towards it appearing on the front page.

You can also associate any person with a photo (something you can’t do on flickr, where you can only tag a photo with a person’s name if you like), and there is very tight integration with Google maps to allow geographic information to be included with a photo.

30 Boxes Ready To Take Out Online Calendar Space,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.30boxes.com""><img alt=""30 Boxes Logo"" class=""shot2"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/30boxes-logo.jpg""/></a><a href=""http://www.30boxes.com"">30 Boxes</a> is an online calendar application that is targeting the mainstream consumer market who until now have not adopted calendaring online or offline. 30 Boxes is another contender in a very crowded market (as <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/01/30/spongecell-an-ajax-calendar/"">previously noted on Techcrunch</a>) which has recently confirmed Google as the latest entrant (also <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/08/exclusive-screenshots-google-calendar/"">seen on Techcrunch</a>). 30 Boxes has some strong differential points and the team has implemented some great ideas that make online calendaring simple to use. I have been using it for over a week now as my primary scheduler and have been impressed enough to continue to use it. My previous attempts at online calendaring using some of the other apps now available (<a href=""http://www.kiko.com"">Kiko</a>, <a href=""http://www.calendarhub.com"">CalendarHub </a>and <a href=""http://www.airset.com"">Airset</a>) all failed after a few days, but 30 Boxes is hanging in there for me.</p>, <p>There are a few reasons why, and they are good differentials that 30 Boxes has over the current competition. The first is natural language schedule additions – how this works is to add a meeting or appointment I enter something like <em>‘meeting with investors at 3pm tomorrow’</em> and it will create that meeting. If I wish to invite somebody else to the meeting I add <em>+friend@friend.com</em> to that string and it will send them a notification. This might sound complicated to learn but with the random examples below the entry box you quickly pick it up and get to learn what can be done.</p>, <p>The interface itself is very simple – it is a calendar view and you can click on any day to view appointments (which can also give you a print view – handy when you want to print out your appointments for the day and take them with you) or easily edit the details or add further detail. You calendar has a private view (which you see), a shared view (your buddies view of what appointments they have with you) and a public view (to include in your blog or anywhere else, you can mark appointments as public/private).</p>, <p>It was a combination of the nice interface, usability and these simple features that have made 30 Boxes my default calendar now. I can see why they already have 22,000 users and adoption outside of the usual early adopter circle.</p>, <p>More advanced users will enjoy the complete openness of 30 Boxes – they are rolling out an open API that allows full unrestricted access to your calendar, allow ‘remote skinning’ (ie. Skin your calendar with CSS files that are hosted on another server), they are commited to supporting greasemonkey scripts and have made it easy for them to be developed and have full open syndication of your profile and your metadata. This openness has already seen some mashups and plugins developed such as a Firefox plugin for adding items to your schedule, Outlook integration and developer libraries for a number of development languages and environments.</p>, <p>In your profile you can link in your profiles from other sites (<a href=""http://flickr.com"">Flickr</a>, <a href=""http://linkedin.com"">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=""http://myspace.com"">MySpace </a>etc.) and with open syndication 30 Boxes can become your primary profile on the web that can be used in other applications. This is the beginnings of a social network that 30 Boxes are aiming to build around their application that will be completely open.</p>, <p>One issue that I had was with timezones, since I skip between timezones frequently I have some issues such as when  I fly from Australia to the USA and go back in time, but an upcoming feature will allow me to add the timezone of an appointment so the calendar will be able to sort it out. This is a complex problem that 30 Boxes is tackling but people that are in my circumstance do not make up a large portion of their user base.</p>, <p>30 Boxes has been developed by <a href=""http://www.83degrees.com"">83degrees</a>, a California based company. The founders of 83degrees are Narendra Rocherolle, Nick Wilder and Julie Davidson who were prior founders and made up the management team of Webshots (which was sold to Excite@Home in 1999, and the repurchased in 2001, and then sold again to CNET in 2004). They are experienced in user interface design and building apps that will appeal to everybody from a casual user through to developers, and so far they have done this well.</p>, <p>Calendaring might be a very crowded space, but 30 Boxes have managed to distinguish themselves well and I would rate them as the best contender to take on CL2 when it is released by Google. 30 Boxes are constantly releasing new features and improvements which you can keep up with <a href=""http://30boxes.com/blog/"">at their blog</a>.</p>, <p><img alt=""30 Boxes Screenshot"" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/30boxes-screen1.jpg"" width=""450""/></p>]"

The result is that you can learn a lot more about your visitors from a lot less information that is found in analytics packages.</p>, <p>Installing Crazy Egg to track your site is a simple 2 step process, the first step is to tell your app your sites URL, so it can grab a copy of it, and the second step is to insert a javascript code snippet into your site which it will give you. The interface to all this is very simple and intuitive. Once you are setup you wait a few minutes and then the statistics will start flowing back to Crazy Egg. The best way to show what it does, since my words will not do it justice, is with a screenshot</p>, <p><img alt=""crazy egg heatmap"" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/crazyegg-heatmap.jpg"" width=""450""/></p>, <p>The above screenshot shows the heat overlay, which is where users are clicking and focusing their attention. Other parts of the application will show you where users click, and how many times.</p>, <p>Crazy Egg plans to launch in April and already has 4000 beta visitors signed up. There will be a free option which will be based on the number of visitors per month (the free option is likely to be up to 5000 visitors) and then paid options if your site has more visitors. Crazy Egg was developed by a team of 5 people based around the USA over the past few months, and the interface for the statistics is all client-side Javascript, with RubyOnRails in the backend. They have been self-funded to date but are exploring funding possibilities as well as potential partnerships (they are looking for distributors).</p>, <p>The aim of Crazy Egg is for webmasters and site owners to learn from visitor usage patterns and improve their site based on what they learn from the application, as opposed to having page after page of statistics. Some features currently in development will allow users to track ad performance so that ad campaigns can be refined, RSS integration and demographic information of your visitors (filtering the map based on which visitors you wish to see).</p>, <p>The competition at the moment has similar services but targeted at large corporations (such as the site optimization services from <a href=""http://www.atlassolutions.com/enterprise/usability"">Atlas</a>), Crazy Egg delivers this kind of technology and tracking ability down to a simple level so that any body can use it and more importantly so that most people can afford it. It is very simple to understand, implement on your site and the results are stunning. Another site promising optimisation tools, probably not as cool as the heat overlay in Crazy Egg, is <a href=""http://www.mapsurface.com/"">Map Surface</a> – which is currently in a private beta.</p>, <p>Most site owners now are probably tracking conversion rates and looking at statistics, but when it comes to trying to enhance those results it is often trial and error. This is the situation I have been in for a long time now, but with Crazy Egg I can see what my users are doing and learn from that then optimize my site accordingly.</p>, <p>Pete Cashmore at Mashable also <a href=""http://mashable.com/2006/03/10/crazy-egg-is-crazy-delicious/"">reviewed Crazy Egg a few days ago</a>.</p>, <p><img alt=""Crazy Egg Screenshot"" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/crazyegg-screen2.jpg"" width=""450""/></p>]"

Last.fm proves widgets work – but do the Brits get it?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">CBS-owned <a href=""http://www.Last.fm"">Last.fm</a> says 3rd party web widgets hooked into its API added 19 million music users to its user base in January, in addition to the 21 million active users accessing the service through the Last.fm site itself. As a result it has launched a dedicated showcase site to highlight the best widgets and tools. The site opened to developers in 2003 but has not set up a dedicated home for them at <a href=""http://build.last.fm/"">build.last.fm</a>. Some of the widgets that have come from this innovation include a tool that shows favourite CD covers on WordPress blogs, a tool that graphs music preferences and one that tracks listening habits on a user’s mobile phone.</p>, <p>So here’s a question. Why was is it that at last night’s <a href=""http://www.mashupevent.com/event/mashup-event-widgets-gadgets"">Mashup event on widgets on London</a> last night, so many audience questions about widgets were along the lines of “Where’s the money?”.

But I have to ask, what about lots of people putting the widget in the perfect place for their brand? Ever heard of the long tail? This feels like a very old and dead conversation.

Mailroom Manages Small Business Mail,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.sproutit.com/mailroom""><img alt=""sproutit logo"" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/sproutit-logo.jpg"" width=""175""/></a></p>, <p>I am constantly looking for new products that will make my own business more efficient and perform better, and while finding a lot of good solutions for key problems, more often I find solutions to problems that I hadn’t really thought of. The latest solution that I am using now that saves us both time and help us perform better is <a href=""http://www.sproutit.com/mailroom"">Mailroom</a> from <a href=""http://www.sproutit.com/"">Sproutit</a>. Mailroom is a web-based small business email management application that allows multiple users to manage multiple email addresses effectively.</p>, <p>The way it works it that you point all your sales, support and general email to your Mailroom account from where you can have multiple users read them, respond to them, assign them and clearly see which emails need attention. One of the really strong points of this solution is that when replying to emails it allows you to drop in standard responses based on the email you have received and previous responses to similar emails. There is no need to setup standard template responses as you can pick and choose which paragraphs you wish to reply with based on what you wrote previously.</p>, <p>With a single place for all emails it means that all your staff can work as a team in replying to emails, and with the response suggestions they can’t really go wrong. If they can’t respond to an email then they simply assign it to somebody who can. This sure does beat having a single email account where you often get into an internal email thread about who is going to respond to it, or worse 2 people respond to it. Also a lot better than routing rules on your mail server, or not having a sales query responded to because your only sales guy was on holidays.</p>, <p>As with all good web solutions, Mailroom was born from Sproutit’s own frustration with handling business email efficiently. Sproutit was founded by <a href=""http://www.okito.net/"">Charles Jolley</a> (CEO), <a href=""http://texan.blogs.com/"">Chris Bauman</a> (CFO) and Peter Gohman, (Operations). They are a California company but the trio moved to Prague, in the Czech Republic last September during the bootstrapping phase of the business. They will be returning to the Bay Area in summer but at the moment have another 9 team members living in various parts of the world. Sproutit debuted Mailroom at the DEMO conference recently (<a href=""http://www.demo.com/demonstrators/demo2006/63034.html"">you can see the video here</a>) and have had a good uptake of users, to the point that after only a few weeks they had to expand their server setup.</p>, <p>The future looks bright for Mailroom and they are constantly refining and enhancing the product, almost on a daily basis. Over the next few months users should expect more features such as having the ability to have Mailroom to take care of all email, not just support and sales. Pricing starts at $19 per month (100 emails a day – spam not included) through to $199 a month (2000+ a day), all plans allow for an unlimited number of users.</p>, <p>There are a couple of key points with this solution, the first is better email management and in turn better customer management. The second is faster responses which will save you time and overall better customer service. There is a key value proposition here for small businesses who can use the free account to find out just how much hassle it saves them. Getting setup with Mailroom is simple and the pricing is reasonable considering the time being saved in having not only a hosted email solution, but one that saves you time and enables you to serve your own customers better. I didn’t see much from the competition that can compete on ease of use, features, price and value – that’s why we are still using Mailroom and will continue to.</p>, <p><img alt=""Sproutit Screenshot"" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/sproutit-screen.jpg"" width=""450""/></p>]"

Fight Identity Theft with TrustedID,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.trustedid.com""><img src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/trustedidlogo.gif"" style=""float:right;""/></a><a href=""http://www.trustedid.com"">TrustedID</a> launched their first product, <a href=""https://www.trustedid.com/press/IDFreeze_PRN_0313.html"">IDFreeze</a> yesterday (and announced funding by Draper Fisher Jurveston) to help protect consumers from identity theft. I met with co-founder Scott Mitic today about his company.</p>, <p>Identity theft is a really big and really expensive problem. In the U.S. alone, ten million people per year fall victim to identity thieves – and sometimes it takes years to track down what’s happened, shut down fake credit accounts in victims’ names and restore their credit and name to good standing. Shredding mail and other personal documents is not enough to protect yourself, either. Last year, over 50 million consumer data records were lost by corporations.  The FTC estimates that identity theft costs our economy about $50 billion per year. For more information on  identity theft, see <a href=""https://www.trustedid.com/resourceCenter/identityTheftFacts.html"">here</a>.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>And things aren’t getting better. Twelve states have enacted legislation that allows consumers to lock down credit – meaning no third party can request to view your credit information unless and until you unblock your credit report for them. A whole group of companies, including credit bureaus, auto dealers and retailers, are opposed to this kind of legislation because it makes their job – selling your credit information and/or opening new credit accounts for you – harder. To fight this state-level legislation, they are fighting hard at the federal level to enact <a href=""https://www.trustedid.com/resourceCenter/outlawingIdentiyTheft.html"">new legislation</a> forbidding states to regulate this area…and it looks like they might suceed.</p>, <p>This is where TrustedID comes in. First, they are fighting the federal legislation and trying to expand state level consumer protection laws. And second their new product, <a href=""https://www.trustedid.com/products/idFreeze.html"">IDFreeze</a>, will help consumers protect their credit.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>The product works in different way depending on where you live. If you are in one of the twelve states that allows consumers to freeze their credit report, they will handle this for you (there are lots of fees and paperwork involved in getting this done – more hurdles that the credit bureaus have put in place to discourage consumers from doing this). If you are in another state, they will put a flag on your credit report that requires companies issuing you credit to contact you separately and verify that you intend to open a credit account. Either way, your level of protection will increase dramatically.</p>, <p>And if there is a problem with your account in the future, TrustedID will work to get your credit score cleaned up on your behalf.</p>, <p>The costs is $8 per month. I recommend everyone in the U.S. strongly consider using this service.</p>, <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 3/14/06 – The harshness of the comments below rivals what I saw on a <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/01/24/tellos-made-some-mistakes-already/"">post about Tello </a>that I wrote in January.

I apologize to anyone who thinks that me showing this level of enthusiam for a company means that I am being paid off somehow – that isn’t true for this post or any other that I’ve written or will write in the future.

Amazon: Grid Storage Web Service Launches,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/s3""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>Amazon Web Service is launching a new <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/s3"">web service tonight called S3</a> – which stands for “Simple Storage Service”. It is a storage service backend for developers that offers “a highly scalable, reliable, and low-latency data storage infrastructure at very low costs”.</p>, <p>I was able to speak with Adam Selipsky (Amazon Web Services VP of Product Management and Developer Relations), Dave Barth (Product Manager for Amazon S3) and Andrew Herdener (Senior Public Relations Manager for Amazon) today about the service.</p>, <p>They’ve built the back end for the <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/11/21/companies-id-like-to-profile-but-dont-exist/"">number one requested company</a> that I wrote about late last year – reliable and cheap online storage. I’ve been watching this space very closely, even <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/01/31/the-online-storage-gang/"">profiling a number of new entrants</a>, and I have to say that S3 changes the game entirely. Move over <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/06/google-drive-what-we-know-so-far/"">Google Drive</a>, Amazon just stole your thunder (for now).</p>, <p>Until now, a sophisticated and scalable data storage infrastructure like Amazon’s has been beyond the reach of small developers. Amazon S3 enables any developer to leverage Amazon’s own benefits of massive scale with no up-front investment or performance compromises. Developers are now free to innovate knowing that no matter how successful their businesses become, it will be inexpensive and simple to ensure their data is quickly accessible, always available, and secure.</p>, <p>Here are the facts: This is a web service, and so Amazon is not releasing a customer facing service. They are offering standards-based REST and SOAP web services interfaces for developers. Entire classes of companies can be built on S3 that would not have been possible before due to infrastructure costs for the developer.</p>, <p>Virtually any file type is allowed, up to 5 GB. Files may be set as public, shared or private and will have a unique URL.</p>, <p>Pricing is cheaper than anything else I’ve seen: $0.15 per GB of storage per month, and $0.20 for each GB of data transferred up or downstream. This translates to <strong>$15 per month for 100 GB of storage</strong>, net of any transfer fees (to move that much data on to S3 would be a one time cost of $20). These prices are going to be significantly below the development and ongoing costs for small or medium sized storage projects – meaning a lot of the front end services I’ve previously profiled will be much better off moving their entire back end to S3.</p>, <p>This is game changing.</p>, <p>See <a href=""http://blogs.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2006/03/amazons_newest.html"">Rob Hof at Business Week </a>for his thoughts on S3 as well. He says “it should put to rest the notion, still popular among a few analysts, that Amazon is just a retailer.”</p>]"

However, accuracy-enhancing technology and visual — rather than haptic — feedback are also keys to success,” said Paul Brown, senior user experience analyst at Strategy Analytics.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.strategyanalytics.net/default.aspx?mod=PressReleaseViewer&amp;a0=3454"">Press Release</a></p>]"
Vast – Aggregating Listings From The Whole Web,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.vast.com""><img alt=""vast logo"" class=""shot"" height=""96"" loading=""lazy"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/vast-logo.jpg"" width=""117""/></a></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.vast.com"">Vast </a>is a search service that crawls the entire web and structures the data that it finds so that it can be categorized fully and indexed. The team launched a developer preview of the service tonight with three initial verticals available – Cars, Jobs and Profiles. Vast does an extremely impressive job of finding and categorizing data in the long tail – making it very simple for others to find listings from anywhere on the web.</p>, <p>The first thing that amazed me was how big Vast was. They crawl over 3 billion web pages and their intelligent algorithms have indexed 4.4 million cars for sale, 4.7 million job listings and 8.6 million user profiles – and this is just the beginning.  This already makes Vast the largest car sale database on the web, the 2nd or 3rd largest job listing site, and in the top 5 for number of personal listings (profiles from social networks, blogs etc.).</p>, <p>The key to Vast is that they have done an excellent job of aggregating the long tail, as well as the top sites, and they want developers to now ‘steal this site’ (as it says on their homepage). Vast is making all this information available through an API which developers and site owners can use to integrate with other services or to build their own services with. The licensing terms for the API are as liberal as they can get – they just ask that you don’t do anything illegal and that you attribute Vast as the source of your data. Developers can now build their own implementation of the world largest auto search site in a matter of days and do what they like with it (place ads on it, etc.). In fact, the Vast.com site itself is an implementation of this API that took only a couple of weeks to write.</p>, <p>There are a few secrets to Vast that makes them very good at aggregating listings and organizing them. The first is that they are very good at crawling the whole web, not just the pages that every crawler can see but also beyond authentication screens and into what is known as the ‘deep web’. Vast is very good at extracting information out of all types of web pages, those with complex markup, Javascript, Flash , different document types etc. so the index is very comprehensive.</p>, <p>The second is the artificial intelligence they have developed that recognizes a listing and pulls the vital metadata out of what is usually a messy web page and indexes that. For cars this is the make, model, year, price, location information (amongst many other fields). Vast isn’t built with particular verticals in mind, it learns what it needs to find and what a job listing looks like, what an auto listing looks like, so it will only take the Vast team a month or so to setup a new vertical and have the crawlers find all the information required for it.</p>, <p>What they have also developed well is spam filtering methods, Vast CEO <a href=""http://www.startupboy.com"">Naval Ravikant</a> told me that 70% of the listings that they find are spam or duplicates. The results that you get out of Vast are generally very clean.</p>, <p><img alt=""vast screen 1"" class=""shot2"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/vast-screen1.jpg""/></p>, <p>The Vast business model is that later on at some point they will have paid listings within the search results, but only in results that do not have adequate results – so they will be adding sponsored listings in to ‘fill up’ the long tail of their own results. To the integrators, they just see these listings as any others. All listings link back to the original site so there isn’t as much of a threat of site owners wanting to block the Vast crawler as it is beneficial to them to have their listings indexed and syndicated out.</p>, <p>Vast was founded in April of 2005, but the project has been in development since 2000 and has taken multiple forms but has always been based around search. Vast is 21 people in total spread around the world with a development hub in Belgrade, Serbia and an office in San Francisco, California. They were funded by <a href=""http://www.leapfrogventures.com/"">Leapfrog Ventures</a> and <a href=""http://www.clearstone.com"">Clearstone Ventures</a> last April. Vast have established a very unique culture at which I really admire – the company is very engineering focused with every employee having a programming background and contributing code to this project. The team in San Francisco is Naval along with a few others such as a COO and VP of Products (who both also code). Their strong engineering focus comes through in their product which even at such an early stage is very well implemented, clean and stable with a huge (vast!) index.</p>, <p>Naval said that before he joined the team, he was looking for somebody who was crawling the web and dragging information out of thousands of sites, and he was surprised that not many people were taking that approach. Vast’s competition at the moment in the jobs space would be <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com"">SimplyHired</a> and <a href=""http://www.indeed.com"">Indeed</a>, both of who index other sites – but the difference here being that those sites are not indexing the long tail, and a lot of human intervention is used to add source sites and to filter them. Vast’s job listings have identified 25,878 source sites – and it is finding more and more of them every day.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.google.com"">Google</a> is in a position to attempt to recognize data in the way Vast does, they are already crawling the whole web – but the Google Base approach has been to setup a marketplace where others list their goods on its site. With the technology Vast have in finding listings in the long tail as well as the mainstream sites, it means they are not dependant on any one or few sources of data, and they will always be a superset of other sites out there attempting to aggregate listings just because of how well they crawl into the long tail.</p>, <p>Vast has it all for success, a smart and experienced team, some fantastic and innovative technology and a market strategy with its open API that will see it being used everywhere and widely adopted.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.vast.com""><img alt=""vast screen 2"" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/vast-screen2.jpg"" width=""450""/></a></p>]"
Fox to Acquire Startup NewRoo,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.newroo.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>Fox Interactive is in the closing stages of acquiring unlaunched startup <a href=""http://www.newroo.com"">NewRoo</a> for “less than $10 million,” according to very reliable sources.</p>, <p>This follows Fox Interactive President Ross Levinsohn’s <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/02/fox-interactive-announces-acquistion/"">dramatic announcement </a>at a recent UTR conference that “they’ve acquired someone in this room,” leading to serious blog speculation as to who the acquired company might be. While NewRoo did not present at the event, it turns out that they were in fact in the room at the time.</p>, <p>NewRoo is a real-time news aggregator that allows users to create their own customized news and content pages. The company has not launched. See my <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/02/03/newroos-real-time-news-aggregator/"">previous post on NewRoo</a> for a full profile of the company.</p>, <p>While this is a small acquisition for Fox, there is a clear product synergy with their Myspace and Fox Sports online properties – users of those sites can create their own music/youth related content sites in the case of Myspace, or sports related news sites in the case of Fox Sports. Given Ross’ stated infatuation with user-generated content, it isn’t hard to see how NewRoo’s technology can add to their overall strategy of generating more page views without paying for the actual content generation.</p>, <p>UPDATE: <a href=""http://www.paidcontent.org/pc/arch/2006_03_14.shtml#054090"">Rafat at PaidContent </a>says Yahoo was also in the running to acquire NewRoo.

Games Bigger than Ringtones in the U.K.,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""unionjack.jpg"" class=""right"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/unionjack.jpg""/>Mobile gaming is big business in the U.K. according to market researchers at GfK M² GameDaily is reporting today.

The mobile gaming market is almost four times the size of the market for full music tracks, and eight times the current market for video downloads.</p>, <p>The mobile carriers also are reaping the rewards, as almost 90 percent of game downloads were through the mobile network channels.

How to write a Mike Arrington blog post,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""shot2"" src=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/mike.jpg""/></p>, <p>As we “work” our way through the holiday (or winter break as the school system calls it) we are once again reminded of Mike Arrington’s skill at dominating the trainwreck formerly known as The Conversation. I’ve watched Mike at close range for some number of years now, and it never ceases to amaze me how he does this.</p>, <p>For example, several weeks ago we did a Gillmor Gang episode live onstage at LeWeb. For two days I noticed Mike trying to come up with an angle to run with – Loic LeMeur’s jacket fabric just one of several weak entrants – but nothing to write home or about. Yet within seconds of Loic making a comment about bloggers and what I’d like to call social mediots not having a life, Arrington suddenly lurched upright like a dog at the beginning of a hunt, then sat back in an insolent slouch.</p>, <p>You know the rest, if you were online anytime in the next several days. My guess is that as soon as Mike understands the opportunity, all other sensory input continues to be recorded and stored while he plays out the scenario he’s identified. Analyzing his posts would reveal much of the same dynamic, but Arrington has a few tricks up his sleeve that separate him from others. A few notes on the Arrington methodology follow:</p>]"

"Jigsaw is a Really, Really Bad Idea","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.jigsaw.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>Well, just as soon as one company <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/22/plaxo-now-with-less-evil/"">stopped being evil</a>, another one has stepped in to take its place. <a href=""http://www.jigsaw.com"">Jigsaw</a> is a <strong>marketplace for contact information</strong>, and it is very efficient. It boasts detailed personal contact information for 2.5 million people, and 7,000 new people are added every day.  If you want the name, title, email address, direct phone line and/or address of any executive of any company, there is a very good chance Jigsaw will already have it in its database and will sell it to you. And if you are a sales guy and have no ethical concerns about where you get your contact information, you probably already know all about Jigsaw.</p>, <p>Unlike competitors like Hoovers and InfoUSA, which gather company information by semi-legitimate means such as scouring SEC filings, cold calling companies and asking for information, and reviewing other public documents, <strong>Jigsaw simply pays people to upload other people’s contact information</strong>. Users are paid $1 for every contact they upload, and some users have uploaded information on tens of thousands of people. <a href=""http://www.jigsaw.com/demo/online_demo_home.html"">See the demo</a> (and note the other demos on that page as well). Jigsaw is also self correcting, and incentivizes people to also correct bad contact information.</p>, <p>That’s right, the next time you hand out a business card to someone or otherwise divulge your contact information, you may be handing it out to the entire world.</p>, <p>Here’s how it works: Sign up and start downloading contact information. This includes name, title, company, address, email and direct phone line.

They say “This privacy policy covers how, when and why we collect, use and share information about our users…<strong>This policy does not apply to our collection and use of data about companies and contacts contained in our database system</strong>.”</p>, <p>Is Jigsaw legal? Maybe in the U.S., although I’d love to see a class action case brought against them. Is it ethical? Absolutely not. Every Jigsaw employee and investor has dirty hands and they should be ashamed of themselves.</p>, <p>Like Plaxo, Jigsaw makes money while pushing costs to other people. In Plaxo’s case, its spam. In Jigsaw’s case, its making private contact information public. The problem here is that Jigsaw’s actions aren’t easily found out by people getting constant cold calls and emails – it’s very unlikely they’ll know that these people got this contact information at Jigsaw in the first place.</p>, <p>If they wanted to do this right, they’d set up a marketplace where individuals could choose to sell (or give away) their contact information. The owner of the data could set the price, and Jigsaw could take a cut. Would this model work? Perhaps not, but that just proves my point. The only reason Jigsaw does work is because they don’t have to bear the costs that they push to third parties – all of the people who are in their database.</p>, <p>Management team and investors <a href=""http://www.jigsaw.com/contactus/Management.html"">are here</a>.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/jigsaw455.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Rafe Needleman emailed to point to an <a href=""http://www.release1-0.com/freshproduce/article.php?serialnum=FRP200411300000"">article he wrote about Jigsaw</a> in late 2004.

Think of it as Google Groups light – groups can be created on the fly, and quickly disposed of when done.</p>, <p>If you don’t wish to signup to the service, you can instantly start a conversation with up to 3 participants right from the homepage. If you signup, which is a straight-forward process, you can invite more people into the conversation and expose other features. The aim of 9cays is to organise group communication and to make it much easier to manage than having CC’d addresses in ordinary email. Participants are able to subscribe and view the discussion thread using feeds, and view attachments etc. on the web interface. It is very simple to add a message to the conversation, you send an email to a 9cays.com address that is setup for each group.</p>, <p>In the future 9cays will be adding more functionality and the ability to group these ad hoc message groups under a single account or name. There is also an Outlook plugin being developed. 9cays has been in development for 6 months and they are sticking to their philosophy that there should be an easier way to group ad hoc conversations online.</p>, <p>9cays can fill a gap where temporary mailing lists are required where you would normally have the discussion CC’ing a group of people. This way you can manage the list, view the conversation online and expand the list of participants. The service is currently completely free, for more information <a href=""http://blog.9cays.com/"">visit their blog</a>.</p>]"

You do not need to leave a comment on the post to track it with co.mment.</p>, <p>And the best part is that you can use it without creating an account – it will track things and keep them organized based solely on a cookie.

Consumerist is running a story about an Alabama woman who is getting shafted by Cingular. The story goes that the woman owned three phones on AT&amp;T, which was, of course, bought out by Cingular.

Ban on 3G Handsets With Qualcomm Chips,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""itc.jpg"" class=""center"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/itc.jpg""/><br/>
The U.S. International Trade Commission has ordered a ban on new 3G handsets that contain Qualcomm chips, as these infringe on a Broadcom patent. It gets a little confusing… see phones that have already been sold in the U.S. are exempt, and this includes future sales of the same model. Further, current handset brands don’t need to change either. But any new 3G devices will have to forgo the Qualcomm chip.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.moconews.net/entry/419-itc-orders-ban-on-new-3g-handsets-with-qualcomm-chips/"">[Via mocoNews]</a></p>]"

Zune vs. iPod: Tale of the Tape,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/>When there’s a fight, we go crazy. Blake here at Crunch Gear has been running a cockfighting league in his basement for three years now, just for the conflict. It makes good money, sure, but nothing’s better than putting two prime competitors head-to-head, mano-a-mano and letting them slug it out.</p>, <p>And that’s what Michael at My Tech Lists did with the Zune and the iPod. He took their similarities and differences, put them in the ring, and let the go to town, comparing iPod’s lack of FM tuner against Zune’s shorter battery life, the iPod’s Clickwheel against Zune’s size. It’s fairly comprehensive, but seeing as the Zune isn’t even a product you can buy yet, it’s likely we’ll see a rematch before Xmas.</p>, <p>The winner in the end is the iPod, though the Zune does have a pretty decent showing and can hold it’s pugilistic head up high. No word on if iPod is up against Mr. Sandman or Mike Tyson next, but our money is on iPod keeping the title, at least until early next year.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.mytechlists.com/?p=132"">Zune vs iPod: Which player is right for you?</a> [My Tech Lists]</p>]"
Decline in Mobile Sales in Taiwan Expected,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""taiwan.jpg"" class=""right"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/taiwan.jpg""/>Technology pundits typically look East to see the latest trends, so could we see sales of mobile phones decline in the months to come? While probably unlikely to hit the U.S., sales of mobile phones are actually expected to decline this in Taiwan. The Taipei Times is reporting that mobile sales may falls slight as local service providers reduce efforts to boost new 2G subscriptions due to lower tariffs imposed by the regular. To offset this decline, service operators may instead focus on pushing 3G and 3.5G services.</p>, <p>Operators of 3G will not be affected by the newly imposed price scheme, and already enjoy about 30 percent higher average revenue per user than 2G services. So the news isn’t quite as alarming as it first sounds, but a government-funded forecast predicts sales may drop about two percent from last year.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2007/06/11/2003364802"">Mobile phone sales expected to decline</a> [Taipei Times]</p>]"
Brother can you share a dime?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a class=""shot2"" href=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/sparedime1.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-1114"" height=""315"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/sparedime1.jpg"" title=""sparedime1"" width=""240""/></a>Looking back over the big stories of 2008, I’d have to go with the failed Microsoft/Yahoo acquisition as the least surprising and most interesting drama of the technology world. Coming as it did in the wake of Google’s rapid climb to the top, Yahoo’s failure to resonate and Microsoft’s to take advantage of the flattening of the Web 2.0 curve underscored the hard work ahead.</p>, <p>If it weren’t for the economic crisis and the election of Barack Obama, we might be tip-toeing into 2009 with very little underlying context for how to measure the importance of technology in our daily lives. As realtime media eats its parents and apparently destroys the economic constructs of the previous generation, few of our “thought leaders” seem willing to call the next winners. Instead, they settle for calling out the losers.</p>, <p>Newspapers are a common target. Certainly the handwriting is on the wall around the content, with current digital monetization returning a dime on the print dollar. So the conservative analysis goes: the 90 cents is gone, melting like the Wicked Witch of the West, not to return. The more liberal thinking is that the dime will grow, not fast enough to save the jobs but eventually because the value will find its audience.</p>, <p>Television seems more buttressed against complete collapse, but the banking implosion could foreshadow the speed of decline in broadcast media if some analog to incomprehensible derivatives lies waiting just below the surface. Imagining prime time becoming a shootout between Jay Leno, Comedy Central, and Keith Olbermann may not be too hard if the series cancellations accelerate past some threshold. If Heroes implodes, will Gray’s Anatomy be enough to stem the tide? Hollywood is having a tough time competing with reality these days.</p>, <p>The music business may be entering a climactic phase, as the social networks realize that’s where the real money is pooling. Facebook Connect is the third rail here; if users find out what their attention is really worth, some of these networks will be trampled in the rush for the doors. My money is still with Apple for now, but whoever controls the social graph as DVR will be in the driver seat.</p>, <p>Having just violated the Loser scenario if only a little, let’s handicap the next few months as they might play out. January 20th looms as the first inflection point, where the Republicans have to start playing regulation ball. Given the critical need for funding of the green and healthcare initiatives on the back of the Big Bailout of ’09, it’s a safe bet that we’ll see some posturing from the right overwhelmed by the grace period of economic data taking some time to reflect the impact of the money injection.</p>, <p>In the absence of cable news drama of the usual kind, the focus may shift to the new media rally. Already we’re seeing the beginnings of the attack on Page Rank, the canonization of realtime media, and the roots of a new authority model. In essence, Web 2.0 has lost its brand momentum to the social vortex. Google continues to mine the growing extensions to Adsense, but user awareness of the value of their gestures is changing the nature of acceptable user contracts.</p>, <p>Scoble’s vision of mining the Twitter (FriendFeed) database of gestures is colliding with the notion of the free Web. Couched as a religious issue, the choice seems obvious: the volume of ambient signals outperforms the scoped cloud of qualified micro-communities. This is where the digital dime lives today – not enough to jump but enough to undermine a significant portion of the remaining tail of the dollar.</p>, <p>From the user’s perspective, the choice will soon morph from one of access to one of curated value. A choice of an unmanageable stream of free data or a controlled metered aggregation where the ROI is recorded and fed back into the stream as a constant reminder of its effectiveness and the user’s value to the system. Once the user understands the value of time spent in navigation (filtering) the economics of the system will tip.</p>, <p>Thus we have the race to deliver realtime activity streams with recursive social filtering. We know who the horses are: Facebook, Microsoft, Google/MySpace, FriendFeed/Twitter – and the drivers: Apple, Ebay/Skype, Amazon. Where they meet head on – VoIP over the iPhone, videoconferencing over 3G, Twittercredits redeemable at the popcorn line – is where micropayments meet microcommunities.</p>, <p>Extrapolating from this moment where user value creates economic clout, where does the power reside in funding the new media? On the surface, the incumbents remain in charge – the Oscars, the SuperBowl, the Stones tour, and so on. But how we pay for our entertainment shifts to some degree from the work we do to the way we share our impressions, expertise, insights, humor, and emotions. And even more valuable – what we’re bored by, cheated by, pandered to, and so on. The social capital that’s built by studios, companies, political figures, religious leaders is an ongoing reputational referendum – authority rank in the most dynamic and fluid of systems.</p>, <p>How soon we see this recovery depends on how difficult the transition is from paper dollar to digital dime. The digital dime may be worth more for its efficiency in reaching targeted markets than the anonymous dollar it is replacing. The social clouds we maintain and the affinities they reveal are powerful tools for getting the attention of companies and government, and extracting discounts, responsiveness, and even equity in future products. These shared dimes can add up to real money.</p>]"

From then on, updates are handled through Plaxo so that you won’t receive any more e-mails.</p>, <p>It’s like a stalker telling his stalkee that if she will only marry him, he’ll stop.</p>, <p>And if you <a href=""http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=109"">blog about Plaxo</a>, or otherwise publicly voice your discontent, Plaxo will send a representative to patiently beat you into submission in the comments.</p>, <p>Well, Plaxo has <a href=""http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/2006/03/a_little_less_i.html"">finally announced</a> that they’ve harassed enough people into joining and won’t be making it quite so easy to for users to spam their entire address book. The words they chose certainly tell us that, at least internally, they fully knew how miserable they were making all of us:</p>, <p>…we’ve always known that the update requests were a means to an end — <strong>our goal has always been to get as many members as possible so that these e-mails were unnecessary.</strong> And it looks like we’re finally getting to that end.</p>, <p>As of last week, we’ve past 10 million members. We are now growing at over 50,000 users a day. Due to this great growth, the depth of our network, plus <strong>our heartfelt desire to be good net citizens,</strong> we have started phasing out update requests.</p>, <p>This feature will probably always exist in some form, but <strong>we are no longer aggressively pushing new users to send out e-mails</strong> and are adding restrictions to prevent existing users from sending out large batches. Within the next six months (allowing for releases and upgrades to our base), you should see these messages drop to a trickle.</p>, <p>I’ve bolded text above that I find particularly incredible given Plaxo’s longstanding position that their email blasts were perfectly legitimate, and really, even though we didn’t know it, <em>good for us</em>.</p>, <p>So overall, I’m happy that Plaxo is doing this and I applaud them for it.

On the end-user side all you have to do is press the “call” button that will initiate a call (or a video call) to the call-center.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/skyclick3.jpg""/></p>, <p>This call-center has all the important features you could expect from a professional solution: time management, availability of collaborators, call dispatching, waiting background music, feedback management (below a few exclusive screenshots)…</p>, <p>It has been designed for any kind of corporations whether big or not. Although I am not sure big guys will be first to rush on that solution , I believe that Sky-Click is quite fine for medium and small size businesses searching to reduce operational costs without compromising on customer care policy.</p>, <p>Of course calls are free for end users and for corporations service is much cheaper than any solution available on the market: about 10 USD/ months / collaborator.</p>, <p>Sky-Click can also be used for other purposes like remote training or sales force management.</p>, <p>Pascal Rossini (CEO) and Cyril Lamblard (COO) informed us that Sky-Click should open in a few weeks and in the meantime you can subscribe to <a href=""http://www.sky-click.com/"">their temporary homepage </a>to be alerted on the launch or even write to info (at) sky-click.com.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/sky-click1r.jpg""/></p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/skyclick2r.jpg""/></p>]"
Evoca Sounds Off to Odeo,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.evoca.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>Savannah, Georgia based <a href=""http://www.evoca.com"">Evoca’s</a> new service to record and publish voice recordings has a number of features that allow it to stand out from the “click, record” crowd. I have been in contact with founders Muren Sharpe and Diego Orjuela since December, and tonight they gave me a complete overview of the service.</p>, <p>This young space is already crowded – competitors include <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/11/04/odeo-disappoints/"">Odeo</a>, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/07/27/profile-springdoo/"">Springdoo</a>, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/11/05/yackpack-joins-the-click-record-crowd/"">YackPack</a>,   <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/26/voice-email-with-waxmail/"">Waxmail</a> and others (of these, Odeo clearly has the branding lead). I can see each of these companies struggling to find the right business model, feature mix and consumer messaging. Evoca has a strong case for getting it at least mostly right.</p>, <p>And just to get it out of the way – what I consider to be the killer feature to pull ahead of the crowd, and of course what none of these companies have yet, are even simple tools to edit, enhance and otherwise manipulate a recording. This would be a sort of online and stripped down version of open source <a href=""http://audacity.sourceforge.net/"">audacity</a>.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>Evoca’s core features include a very easy way to record a sound file via a computer microphone or from calling into a phone number (Odeo also has a call in recording feature). With Evoca, however, you can also upload a sound file, or even <strong>record a skype call directly</strong>. As a Mac user I have very few options for recording Skype calls (even Audio Hijacker doesn’t yet properly record Skype calls on the new Intel Macs, and as far as I can tell this is the first product to allow this). PC users have other options for recording Skype, including <a href=""http://www.hotrecorder.com"">hotrecorder</a> and Outlook-based <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/19/skype-outlook-skylook/"">Skylook</a>.</p>, <p>Evoca’s Skype recording feature is (for now) limited to one hour recordings and requires a <a href=""http://www.evoca.com/pro/index.jsp"">premium account</a>, which costs $5 per month.</p>, <p>Once a recording is created or uploaded, users have the ability to add tags, an image and a description, put it into an album and set it up as a public/shared/private file. Groups with multiple users can also be created. If the files are public, an RSS feed is available. Since others can comment on each file as well, <strong>Evoca has basically created a podcasting blog for each user.</strong> Add editing tools as I mention above, and they have a very nice platform.</p>, <p>Files can be accessed via a flash player on Evoca, or downloaded as MP3.</p>, <p>There are other useful features as well, such as human transcriptions of sound files for $.80 per minute, and full search functionality of sound files. Sound search uses speech recognition to recognize search terms in sound files, and is provided by <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/06/17/profile-podscope/"">Podscope</a>. Finally, users can set a price for others to listen to a file, and proceeds will be sent out monthly via check.</p>, <p>Evoca is clearly an ambitious project. The main issue is whether or not they can get and stay ahead of Odeo and become the brand people think of when they want to record and share audio files online.

Verizon's KRZR Drop Imminent,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/>Your RAZR is about to (officially) suck. The over-produced, now-tacky cellphone icon is so everywhere, it now has about as much “cool” attached to it as tickets to a K-Fed concert. Fortunately, it’s about to be replaced by the new Motorola KRZR (Crazer), the follow up to the RAZR (Razor). It appears that Verizon Wireless will be the first camp to bring the long-rumored KRZR to market, and it should drop any day now. Other carriers (all of them, most likely) should getting in on the action soon, but with Verizon’s test site already showing an interactive Flash-based manual, they look as if they’ve beaten the others to the punch.</p>, <p>The KRZR is very RAZR-ish, bit is thinner across the face (as I wish I was). It has most of the same features as the latest RAZR, including EVDO, a 1.3 Megapixel camera, and an MP3 player with MicroSD storage. The KRZR adds some very Chocolate-like touch-sensative hidden media buttons to the front, and brings DUN via Bluetooth to the masses.</p>, <p>If you’re a fan of the current slim RAZR, this phone is for you. It’s got a decent features list in a small, small phone, and should be quite popular. And, once you’ve gotten yours, you can openly mock those RAZR users as being <i>so</i> 2006.</p>, <p><a href=""http://tcache.vzw.com/multimedia/mim/motorola_krzr_k1m/index.html"" target=""_blank"">KRZR</a> [On Verizon’s Test Site, via <a href=""http://www.phonearena.com/htmls/Motorola-s-KRZR-K1m-close-to-Verizon-launch-article-a_1578.html"" target=""_blank"">Phone Arena</a>]</p>]"

The Jobby Experiment,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.gojobby.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>I’ve been testing out a new (in beta) Ajax Job site called <a href=""http://www.gojobby.com"">Jobby</a> this evening. Unlike other web 2.0 job sites like <a href=""http://www.Indeed.com"">Indeed</a> and <a href=""http://www.simplyhired.com"">Simply Hired</a> (which aggregate job listings from around the web), Jobby takes information directly from job seekers, and then focuses on helping recruiters filter through job qualifications fast via tagging and tag filtering. The results are quite stunning and I can easily see other services (not necessarily in the job space) copying some of these features (Ajaxian <a href=""http://ajaxian.com/archives/jobby-brings-job-hunting-into-a-web-20-world"">says</a> its “combines a solid combination of interface and functionality”).</p>, <p>For a job seeker, you input basic information about yourself and you have the option of uploading a resume (a nice touch would be to allow a pointer to resume sites, like Linkedin). You then add tags about your qualifications and availability. I added “techcrunch” and “web 2.0” – for some reason I couldn’t add a tag “blogging”. For qualification tags, you also set your level of knowledge to “newbie”, “skilled” or “advanced”. The interface is exceptional and you don’t have to do more than click a couple of times on a tag cloud to set up tags. You’ll have to try it to fully understand how it works.</p>, <p>Job seekers also have the ability to post a summary of their qualifications directly to another website.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>For recruiters, searching is very easy and filter based. Tags are shown and the recruiter simply checks the tag and level of experience desired, along with geographic information and availability. Each additional filter narrows the result set of candidates. A RSS feed is available for each search, so recruiters can keep on top of new candidates.</p>, <p>There’s a problem with Jobby. There are so many job sites out there that it will be very hard for them to get traction, and there is no real virality to the service.</p>, <p>However, the ability for recruiters to set, at virtually no time cost, highly specific filtered searches for exactly the candidate they are looking for means they will likely use it. And if recruiters start using it, expect job seekers to flow there as well.</p>, <p>Anyone building a new web company with search features should take a look and consider, cough, copying their interface. It’s really exceptional.</p>]"

Google v.

Based on this, I’ve had a chance to test Google’s new search interface as well.</p>, <p>In my opinion, both are lacking but for very different reasons. After testing each, Google’s new interface doesn’t seem to actually do much of anything, and Live.com, while inspired, is very poor in actual performance, mostly speed.</p>, <p>Google first. The quick links have been moved from the top of search to the left sidebar. The green bars do communicate total results information, but that’s it. For the majority of searches, the number of results is not important to deciding whether or not to click on the link. All in all, this is a feature that didn’t need to be released outside of internal testing before being scrapped or quietly incorporated. <strong>Furthermore, it makes no sense that Google would not incorporate blog search results into the sidebar along with froogle, images, news, etc.</strong></p>, <p>Live.com is a different matter. The image search is excellent in that a very large number of results appear on the screen at one time. There are also more search results than on MSN search, and each search has a RSS feeds that can be added to your Live.com home page with a single click. Finally, the infinite scroll bar is a great way to save clicks to further results pages for deeper searches. <strong>But, Live.com has unacceptably slow loading times for searches</strong>, and the infinite scroll bar is extremely slow as well. So slow it is effectively unusable.</p>, <p>All in all, Live.com’s effort is much more creative and head turning than what Google seems to be testing. Others might argue, of course, that Google’s clean interface has served them (and us) very well over the years and needs little, if any, tweaks at this time. As Live.com becomes more responsive and faster, it will be interesting to see if people drift away from Google Search and over to Live.com. Either way, Microsoft finds itself in a difficult position – <a href=""http://battellemedia.com/archives/002451.php"">Google controls over 40% of the U.S. search market</a> v. about 15% for Microsoft.</p>]"

And what they are doing is clearly playing Business Week to get the word out that they are very much for sale.</p>, <p>And I believe <a href=""http://techdirt.com/articles/20060328/102245.shtml"">Carlo at Techdirt</a> nailed it when he draws comparisons to the way Skype handled its PR prior to its <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/09/12/skype-sells-to-ebay-for-41-billion/"">acquisition by ebay</a>: rumors, rumors and more rumors about very high acquisition prices, almost to see how much analysts and journalists could stomach before saying “ok, that’s just ridiculous”. For Skype, the price was $4.1 billion. For Facebook, they’re just seeing how people react to a $2 billion price tag.</p>, <p>The price, by the way, is high but not ridiculous yet. MySpace was sold for acquired by Fox for half a billion dollars last year and has grown significantly since then. Many people are now saying that Fox negotiated a very good deal for itself. And while Facebook is <a href=""http://www.alexaholic.com/facebook.com+myspace.com"">no where near the size</a> of Myspace, it’s no wimp, either. <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/85-of-college-students-use-facebook/"">85%+ of all college students use it</a>, and they are now moving aggresively into the high school market.</p>, <p>A note on alexa rankings for Facebook: Unless you are a member you cannot view content on the site, making the network much more valuable for members but much less likely to get the massive page views and search engine juice that Myspace sites can generate. It’s not a very fair comparison. The simple fact that just about every college student in the U.S. uses it suggests that it has massive value, perhaps even greater than Myspace in the long run.</p>]"
Michiganders Opposes Mobile Fees,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""michigan.jpg"" class=""right"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/michigan.jpg""/>Residents of the big mittens aren’t too happy with new state, county and even local fees that are being imposed on their mobile services.

Testing Goowy Web IM and Online Storage,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.goowy.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a><a href=""http://www.goowy.com"">Goowy</a> is slowly rolling out its new web instant messaging and online storage services to users. I showed screen shots (provided by Goowy) <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/08/goowy-to-add-web-im-file-sharing/"">earlier this month</a>, and have now had a chance to use the features directly. My overall impression: Goowy is turning into a very nice Flash-based desktop replacement, but has some issues to work out on performance.</p>, <p><strong>Instant messaging</strong> compatibility is good (think Meebo – which I’ve written about <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/tag/Meebo/"">here</a>). You can use MSN, Yahoo, ICQ and AOL accounts or talk to other Goowy users directly. Setup was easy, and it worked flawlessly. A number of emoticons are supported. My only complaint is that the first message you send to anyone says “(Sent using goowy web messenger. Check it out at http://www.goowy.com )” which is annoying.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>Goowy IM does not yet support group chat, although CEO Alex Bard says that is coming. Another nice feature is the ability to pull a chat window out of the browser window and into its own resized window on the desktop, to look and feel more like a standard IM client.</p>, <p><strong>Online storage</strong> (see image at end) is a very nice feature add as well. They haven’t built this themselves. Instead they are using the <a href=""http://www.box.net"">box.net</a> API on the back end. Goowy is giving every user 1 GB of free storage, with 5 GB for $5/month coming soon. Given the new pricing benchmarks <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/14/amazon-grid-storage-web-service-launches/"">set by Amazon recently</a>, I expect these prices to come down over time. Goowy storage has a straightforward uploading tool, and files can be tagged and set to private, public or shared.</p>, <p>The only issue I saw with the storage feature was on performance – it was very slow. This is understandable given that the product is still in very early private alpha and I would expect speed to increase dramatically prior to public launch. Box.net needs to add support for a client based uploader too, at the earliest possible date.</p>, <p>Goowy is backed by Mark Cuban (as is Box.net) and other investors. Traffic <a href=""http://www.alexaholic.com/goowy.com?y=r&amp;r=2y&amp;z=20"">continues to rise steadily</a> and they seem to have a very loyal user base based on comments left on this blog from previous writeups. It’s way too early to say what Goowy’s fate will be, but I am encouraged to see them (as well as <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/tag/Netvibes/"">Netvibes</a>) begin to distance themselves from the pack.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/goowystorage.gif""/></p>]"

Palm Buyout Rumor #447; Could This Be It?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/>. Now there are rumors swirling at Palm that a suitor has been calling in an effort to buy them out.</p>, <p>These rumors have plagued Palm for years, and in response the brass generally sends a company-wide email saying something to the effect of “that’s crap, we’re not for sale.” The thing is, this time, there’s been no such email, and the rumors are pointing towards Motorola as the mystery suitor.</p>, <p>In addition, Mark Nelson, an investor who owns 8% of Palm, recently called for the company to actively look at potential buyers. Also, Jonathan Hoopes, an analyst at ThinkEquity, sees Moto’s move on Symbol as a motivating factor for Palm to sell out to an outside group, as it makes them a more attractive way to bolster any smartphone offerings. Symbol helps Moto’s effort to go after RIM, but doesn’t go nearly far enough.

The price is 2c per megabyte downloaded, which works out to be around $1-1.50 per album, much better than the $0.99c a song at iTunes. The reason the prices are so low is because AllOFMP3 and allTunes operate in Russia, where they claim they are complying with local copyright law and paying royalties back to artists and labels. The legality of the service is questionable, but they have been in operation for years now with no seeming threat to their existance.</p>, <p>The catalog is very broad, I was able to find some rare international music that I hadn’t heard for years, as well as all the usual classics. The preview feature is just awesome, it allows you to listen to a low-quality version of each song from within the player – not just a snippet but the full song (as long as you have credit in your account).

For sophisticated audiophiles, allTunes allows you to download your songs in a variety of codes and bitrates, from almost-lossless through to 64kbps MP3.</p>, <p>AllOFMP3 has been a service I have constantly used for years now, and allTunes has made it even better.

However savvy bloggers who like to play with html snippets to customize their own widgets (for example to resize or remove some text) will probably go old-school and will still do it manually.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/typepadw6.jpg""/></p>, <p>But the true novelty is that (at last!) <strong>Typepad decided to open their APIs </strong>for the community to build new widgets and enlarge the choice of services and items that will be available to Typepad blog users. The how-to is explained <a href=""http://www.sixapart.com/typepad/widgets/developers"">here</a>.</p>, <p>Good ideas never come alone. WordPress released a few days ago also <a href=""http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/02/25/wordpress-widgets/"">SiderBar widgets   </a>as well as APIs for developers to build new items which is <a href=""http://www.technorati.com/search/wordpress.com%20widgets"">quite discussed</a>. The easiness of integration in a blog is comparable to Typepad. One thing I liked there, is the possibility in a nice Ajax interface to edit your own text and place it in the side bar. The widget catalog (recent comments/ feed/ Flickr / Delicious and others) is not huge yet, but it sure will be soon.

The Wireless AMBER Alert initiative is a good example of how text messages can be used to help others.</p>, <p>“Last year, 158 billion text messages were sent in the U.S. alone, which is up 95% from 2005,” said Steve Largent, President and CEO of CTIA-The Wireless Association. “This translates into approximately 300,000 text messages per minute. Moreover, 94% of all text messages are opened and read, something that can be critical in emergency situations when it’s important for the recipient to be aware of the information in a text message.”</p>, <p>Additionally, the CTIA wants to alert wireless users that text messages are the best means of contacting loved ones during a disaster or emergency. These messages use less data than a digital phone call, and thus won’t put the same strain on a communications network. Plus if network coverage is low in a remote area, text messages can be a more effective way to communicate. Finally, the CITA would like to remind all wireless users that there is a time and place for using a mobile phone. Don’t text and drive!</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.wirelessamberalerts.org"">Wireless Amber Alerts</a><br/>

I wanted to look at the web services word and broader economic models.</p>, <p>If you look at how the media has changed in the past ten years there are a few things that have changed how the media comes to you. All the tool shave become very low cost. The Net has taken off for distribution. A large number of new devices have come in the past in the last ten years, taking media to new places. We now have new business models. The world has changed from a few corporations holding on to information and broadcasting it, to a world where it’s up to you what you want to consume.r</p>, <p>You can pull in any information you want. The big shift is a move from a push model to a pull model.</p>, <p>We all know this story in the Web.</p>, <p>Who knows Lee Yung Foo? It’s a large group in China which focuses on manufacturing and supply chain. That means if you are a dress designer , they go find al providers and create the dress for you. They aggregate work. They swap different companies around if you need variations on the product.</p>, <p>IN the past 15 years going to school has changed. In the 80s/90s you’d get a list of courses you’d have to take. Now you get 400 courses out of which you pic 50.</p>, <p>What are the consequences?</p>, <p>Increasing uncertainty? Who knows if someone wants a product or not? There is intensifying competition. The consumer has become hugely powerful. 15 years ago they consumed what was given to them. Now they will decide for themselves what they want.</p>, <p>There is a shift from acquiring to learning about things.</p>, <p>IN the push world one pretends you can anticipate the market. There is top down control, centralised design, is very procedural, tightly controlled, resources centric. In the pull world demand is uncertain, emergent design, decentralised, module, loosley coupled, people centric, open participation, rapid incremental innovation.</p>, <p>Old: Design, deploy, execute, monitor, refine (and repeat). Slow.</p>, <p>New: Find, connect, innovate, reflect (and repeat). Fast.</p>, <p>Abundance of product, intensifying competition, learning, consumer power  – all this adds up to a crap shoot. It’s a roll of the dice.</p>, <p>So you must be able to acquire resources on demand and pull them in at the moment that you need them. And also release those when you no longer need them. Thus you only pay what you use.</p>, <p>Now a long time ago at Amazon we found that 70pc of the time engineers were spending 70% of the time in managing infrastructure.</p>, <p>So we decided to go into a pull model and only release resources on demand. Before that if they needed 50 servers and use only 40 they’d keep 10 unused. So it was better to provide unlimited and let them use just what they needed.</p>, <p>Amazon S3, Amazon EC2 etc etc are the Amazom products which follow the pull model.</p>, <p>Now there are 14 billion objects in Amazon S3.</p>, <p>So the most important thing is that unlimited storage and power this is now available at your fingertips.</p>, <p>(Here endeth the Amazon pitch).</p>]"

The State of Online Feed Readers,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Syndication is undoubtedly the heartbeat of the web 2.0 movement.  A feed reader, the most common solution to consuming synidcated content, saves the user time by monitoring countless sites and sources and providing near real-time updates to one location.</p>, <p>There are a number of different types of readers: web-based, desktop, Outlook based, etc… This post is focused solely on web-based feed readers. I’ve included the big guys plus some up and coming readers with outstanding features and/or performance like News Alloy, Gritwire, Attensa and FeedLounge.</p>, <p>All the web-based feed readers reviewed are free except for FeedLounge, which charges $5 per month.</p>, <p>I examined nine web-based feed readers (for previous reviews of each of these, see the <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/company-index/"">TechCrunch Index</a>):</p>, <p>I did not evaluate MyYahoo, the most widely used web-based reader, or similar products like Live.com, Google IG and Netvibes because these are more virtual desktop applications or portals with RSS reading built in. Heavy RSS users need a more industrial strength application like the ones I have listed above. I believe MyYahoo is a great option for a quick read of your feeds or for on the go feed readers viewing the Internet via cell phone or handheld device, but this service does not have the feature set for a heavy information consumer.</p>, <p>Researching these nine readers further underscores the extremely competitive atmosphere surrounding this industry’s development. On a feature-set basis only, two companies stood out: Rojo and Bloglines.</p>, <p>Google Reader and FeedLounge won my subjective feed-load test, which determines how well the application pulls up a particular feed. The test consisted of loading five feeds and taking the average of the load times and rating the reader on a five-point scale. Interestingly, FeedLounge is the only premium service of the group at $5 a month. Aside from the exceptional performance rating, I wonder what else sets FeedLounge apart from its free competitors. However, many users are religious about readers with a three pane display that FeedLounge, Attensa and Gritwire all offer.</p>, <p>Rojo, a San Francisco-based company which was reviewed previously on TechCrunch, has the most prominent web 2.0 swagger. News Alloy offers a close second though with itís tagging, rating and other content repositioning (i.e. add to Digg, add to del.icio.us).</p>, <p><strong>User Ratings:</strong> Several of the readers offer rating systems, but I think Rojo’s “Mojo” is the most appealing. Mojo, a term reflecting user-generated reviews, mirrors a feature on the popular social news aggregator digg. After entering an item in the feed you can Mojo it to boost its relevance. NewsGator Online also offers a user generated content feature called “Latest Buzz,” which determines and displays the number of people linking to items in NewsGator. News Alloy employs a rating system similar to Rojo that tallies the number of times someone rates an item.</p>, <p><strong>Tagging:</strong> Rojo generates a tag cloud from user-generated tags. Google Reader offers the same feature under a different name, “labels.” It seems FeedLounge uses tagging as the sole search and discovery mechanism. News Alloy also allows tagging of posts.</p>, <p><strong>Social Aspects:</strong> Rojo and Gritwire feature “contacts,” which adds a social aspect to the reader, allowing a user to share information within a network of contacts.</p>, <p><strong>Feed Discovery &amp; Recommendations:</strong> Pluck, a Texas-based social media company, built a feature called FeedFinder into its Web Edition, which improves feed discovery. Rojo recommendations feeds in the top right corner of the layout while you browse.</p>, <p>Attensa, a Portland-based company, offers a reader that has a very professional and clean interface. While lacking many features the rest of the pack has, it pulls feeds up very quickly. In talking with Matthew Bookspan, Attensa’s Director of Product, I learned Attensa will be launching a new and improved version of the web-based reader that should fare better on the comparison chart. Additionally, Attensa will soon offer a mobile-enabled view of its reader, rendering nicely in handheld devices or cell phones.</p>, <p>Gritwire, a company based just north of Chicago, boasts a Flash-based feed reader that performs very well and offers integrated social networking features similar to Rojo. Gritwire uses a contact-list approach that allows you to share feeds among friends. I spoke with Ian Carswell, Gritwire’s co-founder and COO, who said Gritwire has more web 2.0 features in store, and I am curious to see them in action.</p>, <p>News Alloy, offers an Ajax driven reader with lots of power user bells and whistles. Though it underperformed in the subjective feed-load test Mike <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/01/29/newsalloy-reader-fast"">reviewed it previously on TechCrunch</a> and found it to be extremely fast in other operations.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/feedchart1.gif""/></p>, <p>The chart summarizes the research conducted in comparing these readers.  I was not able to speak with every company directly so I may have missed some details. Consider this chart a living document to be updated if additional information becomes available. Also, I have left a number of competitors off this chart – there are so many web-based readers and I had to limit research to what I consider the main players in the field.</p>, <p>If you are looking purely for performance, Google Reader and FeedLounge are the fastest in our tests. Bloglines and Rojo are the best choice if you are looking for a feature rich application (and Rojo blows Bloglines away on “web 2.0” type features).</p>, <p>None, however, yet approach the speed and agility of the best desktop based readers like NetNewsWire and FeedDemon.</p>, <p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> Frank Gruber, who writes the excellent blog <a href=""http://www.somewhatfrank.com/home.aspx"">Somewhat Frank</a>, accepted our offer to write this research piece on TechCrunch.

Motionbox – Best Online Video Sharing So Far,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.motionbox.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>There have been big changes in the online video space since I wrote a comparison post of the companies in the space (<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/11/06/the-flickrs-of-video/"">Flickrs of Video</a>) last November.</p>, <p>Some things haven’t changed: Flickr still hasn’t released a video product, and YouTube (TechCrunch posts <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/tag/YouTube/"">here</a>) is still the reigning champ of online video with just <a href=""http://www.alexaholic.com/youtube.com+flickr.com"">massive traffic growth</a> and mindshare.</p>, <p>But new tools are coming out to make sharing videos online even easier. Both <a href=""http://www.videoegg.com"">Video Egg </a> and <a href=""http://www.grouper.com"">Grouper</a> (TechCrunch posts <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/tag/Video-Egg/"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/tag/grouper/"">here</a>) have downloadable clients that allow encoding to flash on the desktop (saving users from uploading very large files to the service) and some very basic editing features. Grouper also allows users to string together multiple video files (VideoEgg does not yet allow this). Also, while working from the desktop is easier than online, you must install the software. Grouper is not available on the Mac. VideoEgg has a Mac client that works with Safari, but I cannot get it to install on my new Intel based Mac.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>New service <a href=""http://www.motionbox.com"">Motionbox</a>, which will launch in the next few weeks, goes way beyond all of this. <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/michaelarrington/121716797/"">CEO Chris O’Brien and investor Derek Idemoto</a> came by to demo the service to me last week and, well, I’m impressed.</p>, <p>Motionbox doesn’t have a client uploader like Grouper and VideoEgg. You must upload the full video files to the service. And while those uploads are a pain, Motionbox has very good reasons for doing this.</p>, <p>To get what Motionbox is doing, take a YouTube and add a ton of really great editing, mashup and deep tagging features. Like YouTube, Motionbox transcodes files to flash to reduce file size and standardize viewing. But they also store the original files and allow you or those you authorize to download those files and/or purchase DVDs with the files.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/motionboxedit.gif""/></p>, <p>I also had a chance to test MotionBox’s video editiing tools. When editing a video, Motionbox breaks it down visually into frames (see screenshot above). Users can edit the file extensively, including linking several video files and removing any portion(s) of files. Mashups with other users’ public or shared videos can also be created using this editing feature. Frankly, this goes way beyond what anyone else is doing, including VideoEgg and Grouper’s current offerings. All of these changes can be pushed back to the original quality files for downloading or DVD burning.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/motionboxtags2.gif""/></p>, <p>Like YouTube and other services, Motionbox allows tagging of video files. But they also allow <em>deep tagging</em> of parts of video files. Open a file (see screenshot above) select a portion of the video, and tag it.

ESPN Gives It Another Swing,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""espnmobile.jpg"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/espnmobile.jpg""/>ESPN is taking another swing at the third screen, and the leading sports channel believes it is only a matter of time of “phone watching” becomes as common as phone calling. The New York Times today has a profile on ESPN’s latest move to the mobile space, including a look at new division that produces content specifically for the mobile platform.</p>, <p>Sports is a natural it seems for the mobile, and we have to agree with the Times’ take. It is easy enough to check scores, watch some replays and get recaps.

The WinTV-HVR-950 features analog cable TV, ATSC HD digital TV (the standard HD for North America), Hauppauge’s WinTV2000 application to watch and record TV in small or full screen and WinTV-Scheduler that lets you set recording times. The receiver also comes with an antenna that will let you recieve digital TV wherever you travel. Pretty nifty little plug-and-play device if you’re always on the go and don’t want to miss the game or your favorite show. If you’re recording a program in HD you’ll usually take up around 4GB of space per hour, so it would definitely be a good idea to keep an eye on your disk space, especially since laptop drives aren’t usually too big. You also need at least a 2.8 GHz processor to be able record analog TV. Furthermore, unless you’re running boot camp, the WinTV-HVR-950 is only compatible with Windows XP (sorry old Macs).

It’s like instant gratification. Digital Innovations has capitalized on this idea and created the GameDR Smack Talk, a device that talks smack with the push of a button. The Smack Talk plugs into the headphone jack of your Xbox 360 controller (it has its own headset), and with three simple AAA batteries and a push of a button you will have the option of telling your opponent “Go ahead, make my day” (and yes in that voice too). At first, the device didn’t really seem too appealing. Now all I can think about is killing someone hitting the button that says “Get down” (also in that voice) and laughing at him. You have the option of customizing the presets into any sound clip your smack talking heart desires. This means you can get random sounds, audio clips, more one-liners and whatever else you would want to include. Be ready to start using that mute player button if you haven’t already.

"Kevin McCloskey of MobileAware: ""Who put Vodafone in charge of mobile content?""","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""mobileaware.jpg"" class=""right"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/mobileaware.jpg""/>Last week we posted about the recent announcement by Vodafone that it would be utilizing a transcoding application from Novarra for better viewing of traditional Web sites on mobile phones. Since that time, there have been numerous responses that “this transcoding process reduces every Web site to the lowest common denominator.”</p>, <p>And more importantly some industry watchers have suggested that Vodafone UK subscribers would no longer be able to use traditional mobile Web offerings including mCommerce. Kevin McCloskey, CEO of MobileAware, offered his opinion on what carriers such Vodafone are doing to mobile Web browsing.</p>, <p><span id=""more-1185""></span></p>, <p><strong>Mobile Crunch:</strong> What is the main issue of the partnership between Vodafone and Novarra, and how does the transcoding affect Web sites?</p>, <p><strong>Kevin McCloskey:</strong> On June 6th, Vodafone UK unveiled its new Vodafone Mobile Internet which includes Novarra’s auto-transcoding technology to make regular Web pages (HTML) available on mobile browsers (WML or xHTMLmp). While this new service offering succeeds in expanding the amount of content generally available to mobile subscribers, the vast majority of this “new” content is actually irrelevant to mobile users.  The world does not need access to the Web’s 15 billion pages from their mobile phones. For mobile content to be useful to the end user, there needs to be some level of relevancy and immediacy to the information provided. Users need to be able to access and exchange key information such as account details and perform transactions (e.g. mTicketing, mobile betting) as they would from their PC. Obviously a basic level of security applies to these services, but unfortunately auto-transcoding technology does not facilitate log-in authentication and security functionality.</p>, <p>Additionally, auto-transcoding applies “one size fits all” rules to render Web pages to mobile devices. This interferes with and often destroys the look and feel of a company’s website, thereby diminishing their corporate brand and identity.</p>, <p><strong>Mobile Crunch:</strong> What are the options for existing “mobile” and “multi-channel” Web sites designed for mCommerce and optimized mobile browsing?</p>, <p><strong>Kevin McCloskey:</strong> Leading companies across industries have already implemented their own mobile strategies and launched “mobile” or “multi-channel” websites (<a href=""http://mobile.willhill.com"">mobile.willhill.com</a>, <a href=""http://wap.nationalrail.co.uk"">wap.nationalrail.co.uk</a>, <a href=""http://cnnmobile.com"">cnnmobile.com</a>, even <a href=""http://live.vodafone.com"">live.vodafone.com</a>). While these sites were initially destroyed, Vodafone has acted fast to ensure that such “off portal” sites pass through the Novarra engine without any transcoding. This seems to support the notion that Vodafone’s auto-transcoding technology is only relevant to businesses that don’t care about their mobile presence, but is clearly insufficient for enterprises with a well-designed mobile strategy. In essence, this is another attempt to perpetuate the ‘operator portal’ concept, yet actually moves Vodafone closer to becoming a ‘bit pipe’.  A sad realization when you consider how much value mobile network operators have to offer businesses in developing and executing their mobile strategies.</p>, <p>Rather than interfere in business-customer relations, Vodafone and other carriers should leverage their general domain expertise and provide corporate customers with a broad offering of tools and consultation services needed to maximize the unique business benefits of the Mobile Web.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.mobileaware.com"">MobileAware</a></p>]"

Will Wikio challenge Google News and Technorati?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" class=""shot2"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/wikiologous.jpg"" style=""float:right;""/><a href=""http://www.wikio.com"">Wikio</a>, a Switzerland based company, was released in private Beta yesterday night (in French). It is one of the most ambitious web launches born in Europe this year. Pierre Chappaz originated this idea after the successful adventure of his vertical ecommerce comparison engine <a href=""http://www.kelkoo.com/"">Kelkoo</a>, that was sold to Yahoo. He’s going to try to make it again but this time with an interesting news search service after he realized there was no true satisfactory solutions on the market. Wikio is a <strong>smart combination of Digg+Technorati+Google news</strong>.  It should extend to other European countries and USA very soon.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/wikio1.jpg""/></p>, <p><strong>Wikio is a really ‘web2.0’ news search engine </strong>where you can find interesting features and technology and where the role played by the user is very important. Wikio runs search on a library of sources, indexed and qualified manually, that is composed of online media (newspapers, etc..) but also edge content sites (blogs). And here is the first difference with <a href=""http://news.google.com/"">Google News</a>. They are covering more than 10,000 reliable sources (for France but for other country quantity will be important also) when Google News is covering only 500. Each piece of information is defined with a category (economy / high-tech) and a series of tags.</p>, <p>Wikio is a user managed news search engine. It watches, real time, thousands of news sources, gathers hundreds of thousands of stories every day and classifies them by their topics in a multi millions documents database. information classification is based both on its relevancy and on its members popularity who vote, discuss or even write new stories</p>, <p>The search algorithm is a combination of ‘logical’ and semantical requests that will enable association with other relevant words. Only <a href=""http://www.accoona.com/"">Accoona</a> is able to run search like that to our knowledge. On the technological side Wikio has also developed a tool that will convert any web source in RSS format.</p>, <p>Indexing the sources and building the algorithm took about one year of development.</p>, <p>Here is where Wikio will outperform other players. They <strong>integrated all sorts of web2.0 features</strong> so the user will be able to improve the relevancy of the results. They integrated for each search results the already very popular rating /comment system you can find in Digg for example. But unlike Digg (which is mainly tech-oriented although you can virtually post anything) Wikio will cover all categories of information. The user will also have the possibility to edit a news in a given category/tag and each page results is equipped with a mini-wiki ready to be edited.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/wikio3.jpg""/></p>, <p>You can if you wish create your own profile and store your favorite search queries always available at hand. Pierre Chappaz mentioned they would also store your search history as well as clicked and rated news.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/wikio2.jpg"" style=""float:left;""/>The user interface is quite clear and in a way familiar (digg structure / search ). You can easily re-order results according to date/ popularity/ and relevancy and change in a click font size. Each search query is coming with an RSS feed you can subscribe. And one of the most interesting aspects is the automatically generated tag cloud for each query that will help you extend your search intuitively. So if you run a search on <em>TechCrunch</em> it will lead you to web2.0 or blogs or podcasts……</p>, <p>Wikio will soon include podcast search and I would love to see a picture and video search feature to make it complete.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""shot2"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/wikio4.jpg""/></p>, <p>It will open to the public in the next few weeks and will quickly extend to most European countries and USA.</p>, <p>The company is managed by Pierre Chappaz and has ten other employees. It is self financed but will consider a first round by the end of the year. Business model will be based on integration of sponsored links and Wikio bets on viral marketing and the quality of its product to reach critical size (could we suggest integration of sharing features, forward to a friend or even APIs to build mashups and widgets for Typepad/Wordpress).</p>, <p>Will Wikio manage to become a reflex as Kelkoo, Google or Technorati did? That is the question. <strong>Wikio certainly has strong assets in Europe </strong>where competition and localization is close to non-existing (Google news is very limited and they never managed to impose Froogle vs Kelkoo) but they will have to face serious and well funded US players like Technorati, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/03/newsvine-is-perfect/"">NewsVine</a> and recently acquired <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/tag/Newroo/"">NewRoo</a>. Social news is a crowded space and Wikio will be a new feature to bookmark but we can trust Pierre Chappaz expertise in building successful stories to make it happen.</p>, <p>Wikio is a very ambitious project and has a strong technology with a skilled team in vertical search. This is certainly the most interesting European initiative since Skype. To be continued.</p>, <p>You can subscribe to the <a href=""http://www.wikio.com"">beta version here</a>. <a href=""http://blog.wikio.fr/"">Wikio</a> and <a href=""http://www.kelblog.com"">Pierre Chappaz </a>blogs (in French only).</p>]"

Microsoft May Cut Xbox 360 Prices by $100,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/>According to Taiwanese tech news site Digitimes, Microsoft will cut prices of their Xbox 360 consoles quite soon.

"CNET rolls out ""College Live"" at Webshots","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.webshots.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a><a href=""http://www.webshots.com"">Webshots</a>, a photo publishing and sharing service which was acquired by CNET in August 2004, is starting to launch social networking features to compete with the more cutting edge photo services like Flickr. Last month they launched the social networking features. <strong>Later today they will launch a new service called “College Live”</strong>, which targets the 30 million or so U.S. young adults between 18-25 years.</p>, <p>College live is a network of college specific Webshots sites that focus on photos from students at that college, and event planning.  It’s for students only, and Webshots is using the same method as Facebook to try and keep a sense of exclusivity – by requiring the use of a .edu email address. The idea is to create a sense of community around those photos and events, and allow students to get to know eachother. It targets the same audience as Facebook, but offers different features. And while photos uploaded to a specific college site will be grouped there, the individual pictures will also be available on Webshots as well.</p>, <p>A screenshot of a college landing page is below. Additional screen shots (as well as a couple of pictures I took during my briefing) are <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelarrington/tags/webshots/"">here</a>.</p>, <p>Webshots is a very large property, with about 40 million total users and 300 million photos. CNET as a whole, by the way, is still growing at a healthy rate – they had an average of 116 million unique monthly visitors in Q4 last year, which was up 13% from the same period in 2004. Average daily page views increased  to 103 million, up 22 % from 2004. <strong>CNET says they want to be the Viacom of the online space</strong> with a number of standalone properties addressing different market. Along with Webshots, recent acquisitions of dating site <a href=""http://www.consumating.com"">Consumating</a> and food site <a href=""http://www.chowhound.com/main.html"">Chowhound</a> show this strategy in action.

Battle Test: SanDisk Cruzer Titanium,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""center"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/titanium.jpg""/></p>, <p>A few years ago I got a Lexar 2GB USB flash drive for Christmas. It came in a small, unattractive package and stood amongst other far more valuable items. In retrospect, it was probably one of the single greatest and most useful gifts that I’ve ever received. The drive stood with me through a lot and never once failed. Not even when I lost its cap and feared the USB slot would be damaged in my pocket. It endured admirably and eventually became one of my most important possessions.</p>, <p>As a college student, a properly stocked flash drive is an invaluable tool. Backing up files like papers and projects is an absolute necessity and solid state, portable storage is probably the best possible way to complete the task. There is an inestimable variation of options out there, but after receiving from SanDisk a 2GB Cruzer Titanium and a 4GB Cruzer Micro, there is really only one option I’d consider for my preciouses.</p>, <p><span id=""more-1201""></span></p>, <p>The Cruzer Titanium is by far the best flash drive I’ve ever used. Not only does it maintain extremely fast write speeds via USB 2.0, its titanium casing looks quite attractive. Plus it can live through being rolled over by a car, so you can feel completely confident with the safety of your data. The only real complaint is that it only comes in capacities up to 2GB. So if you need more storage space than that, I suggest looking at the 4GB Cruzer Micro. This is essentially the same drive except that it comes in a typical plastic case. Hopefully SanDisk can motivate itself to increase the capacity of the titanium soon.</p>, <p><img class=""center"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/u3.jpg""/></p>, <p>Both drives support the incredibly useful U3 platform. I use a lot of public terminals and I’ve begun to wonder how I ever lived without this. U3 allows users to launch a variety of programs directly from the drive. I used several programs from my older Lexar drive, but U3 makes it significantly easier to run portable software, particularly for the Luddites.</p>, <p>Perhaps the most useful development over my older flash drive is the sliding mechanism both of these Cruzer drives utilize to engage the USB port. That means there is no meddlesome cap to lose. One problem, however, is that the USB slot remains exposed. As I previously mentioned, I walked around with a capless drive for over a year and nothing ever happened, but it still makes me feel awkward. I’d like to see some little cover that snaps down to protect the USB, but I guess it’s not really necessary.</p>, <p>All-in-all, the Cruzer Titanium is by far the best flash drive I’ve ever used and I can’t see purchasing any other 2GB drive. The only reason I could see getting another drive is, as I mentioned above, if your capacity demands exceed the 2GB maximum of the Titanium line–in which case you should consider the 4GB Cruzer Micro which provides identical performance. Otherwise, there is really no excuse.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.sandisk.com"">SanDisk</a></p>]"

Innaworks Introduces alcheMO,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""alchemo.jpg"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/alchemo.jpg""/>Software development on mobile has been essentially divided among two camps including Java ME (Java Micro Edition) and BREW, and this has made development difficult as software creators had to basically make two versions. Innaworks hopes to reduce the effort a bit with their new alcheMo, an automated Java ME to BREW porting solution, which the company is showcasing this week at the BREW 2007 Conference in San Diego.</p>, <p>“alcheMo is technically very impressive. It is the first automated J2ME to BREW porting solution I know of that works on standard unmodified J2ME games. alcheMo has every potential of revolutionizing the way the industry tackles platform fragmentation,” said David Brittain, VP Technology, Superscape. “On the Spring Break: Wild Waves project, alcheMo shows that a single code base is a reality and simultaneous J2ME and BREW development is no longer an expensive luxury. Equally impressive is the quality of Innaworks’ relentless customer service. I enjoyed working with their dedicated and talented team who helped make Spring Break: Wild Waves a success.”</p>, <p>This new software will allow one code base, created by one team to create an app for both Java ME and BREW devices. Additionally, one coding solution means that the work can be done in Java, an easier language for programming, while functional tests need be performed only once to cover both platforms.<br/>

Online Video Sites: Breeding Like Rabbits,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.jumpcut.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>No sooner did I proclaim <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/04/02/motionbox-best-online-video-sharing-so-far/"">Motionbox</a> the best online video sharing service (mostly for its editing and deep tagging tools), than a new contender arrives on the scene. San Francisco based stealth startup <a href=""http://www.jumpcut.com/"">Jumpcut</a>, founded by Mike Folgner and Ryan Cunningham, just launched minutes ago.</p>, <p>In my mind there are now two distinct types of video sharing services. The first is the YouTube crowd and its dozens of clones, which allow easy uploading of files which are then transcoded into flash, and tagging of those files. The goal is to get video and page views, and it’s working.</p>, <p>It’s working so well, in fact, that it raises questions on their business model. YouTube is free but has very real bandwidth costs from showing these videos. They are dealing with this in two ways – by degrading the quality of the flash video files to reduce file size, and by <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/blogspotting/archives/2006/04/youtube_raises.html"">raising another $8m from Sequoia</a>, raising the total to <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2006/04/05/youtube-snags-another-8-million/"">$11.5 million</a>.</p>, <p>The second group does what YouTube does, but also has some basic editing features. Included in this group is Grouper, Motionbox, Jumpcut and, to some extent, YouTube. Grouper and VideoEgg require a client download to use the service. Motionbox and Jumpcut don’t, although Jumpcut says they’ll have one as an option soon. With these last two, the editing occurs online, and therefore facilitates editing by a group on a shared video.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>Jumpcut, as the newest entrant, has some really spectacular features, that should encourage video mashing between users. It’s editing features, also using Flash, are better than what I saw with Motionbox. Any video can be cloned (unless restricted by the publisher), and other clips can be added to the cloned video. Sound files can be added to either overwrite existing audio or mix in with it. They also allow a number of “transition” features as effects. Overall, its pretty cool. Check it out by clicking “remix” on <a href=""http://www.jumpcut.com/view?id=391632888EA411DAAA45BA90607CBD2D"">this video screen</a>.</p>, <p>Like YouTube, finished videos can be kept private, shared or made public. Jumpcuts provides code snippets to allow video playback from blogs and other websites as well. Unlike Motionbox, Jumpcut does not have a deep tagging feature, although Mike Folger says it is being built and that “it’s fairly straightforward using the Flash development tools”.</p>, <p>The service is currently free and allows uploads of up to 50 MB (YouTube allows 100MB). A paid service will be available soon in the $5/month range, and Jumpcut will also have a client install available to allow users to do some of the editing and transcoding work before uploading it to the Jumpcut server.</p>, <p>Overall, the service is eerily similar to Motionbox. Jumpcut has slightly better editing features, and Motionbox’s deep tagging is a definite feature win. Both of these services will be very useful for creating a single video from a group event where lots of different people are recording video – a wedding, for example. Jumpcut has angel funding by Westlake Venture Partners and Great Oaks Capital.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/jumpcut.gif""/></p>]"

But Flickr caught our attention and, at least with the technology-savvy crowd, it has become synonymous with photo sharing.</p>, <p>A whole new crop of services are gunning for flickr and the title of “coolest photo site”. <strong>I call these the “Flickr Gunners”</strong> and I’ve written <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/11/27/23-is-too-much-like-flickr/"">about</a> <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/12/20/bubbleshare-best-photo-service-yet/"">them</a> <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/11/flickr-has-some-catching-up-to-do/"">often</a>. <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/tag/Yahoo-Photos/"">Yahoo Photos</a> and <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/04/04/new-features-at-cnets-webshots/"">Webshots</a>, two newly rejuvenated services, are also combining new and exciting features with their massive existing customer and photo base.</p>, <p>Photo sharing sites are sticky by nature. Once you’ve gone to the trouble of uploading your photos, tagging them and creating albums, it’ll take something very special to get you to move. Flickr had this “specialness” – the social tagging and viewing features built a network effect that made flickr more valuable to a new user as it grew.</p>, <p>But Flickr has weaknesses. <u>First</u>, as I said they are not the biggest photo site. Yahoo Photos, Webshots and others dwarf them both in terms of users and uploaded photos. These larger services can afford to wait and see what works best and then duplicate it (and Yahoo Photos is <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/02/08/yahoo-photos-overview-exclusive-screenshots/"">rolling out new stuff</a> that isn’t available on Flickr. <u>Second</u>, flickr hasn’t done much in terms of new features lately. They missed the video boat entirely, and YouTube now has a big lead in that category. And <u>third</u>, there are a number of UI issues that could easily be fixed but remain unchanged, stubbornly: the need for sub albums, better batch editing features and the ability to view more photos on a page. Yes, flickr has been working hard on scalability issues, but that shouldn’t stop them from evolving the UI and feature set.</p>, <p>And brand new or very young services are rolling out new features regularly. These small companies are hungry and obsessive and will do anything for market share. Here are three I’ve been tracking:</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.bubbleshare.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>I really like BubbleShare. As I’ve written <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/12/20/bubbleshare-best-photo-service-yet/"">before</a>, it takes about 10 seconds from hitting the site for the first time to actually viewing pictures that you’ve uploaded. You don’t even need to create an account.</p>, <p>BubbleShare has added <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/02/bubbleshare-adds-ajax-zoom-feature/"">new features</a> often since launch. Recent upgrades include <a href=""http://www.bubbleshare.com/help/audio"">Audio Caption</a>, <a href=""http://www.bubbleshare.com/bubblebar/"">BubbleBar</a> (a way to bring photos right to your desktop, similar to <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/09/28/speaking-of-loops-slide/"">Slide</a> or <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/09/19/filmloop/"">FilmLoop</a>) and the less serious but really fun <a href=""http://www.bubbleshare.com/album/20960.d3cbc43cc0f/398121"">BubbleCaptions</a>, (where you can add cartoon text captions to photos).</p>, <p>BubbleShare’s big weakness is that they do not allow tagging of photos, or photo search. This service isn’t about discovery, it’s about sharing photos and albums you’ve uploaded/created with others.</p>, <p><a href=""http://blog.ookles.com/""></a></p>, <p></p>]"
"AT&T Cell Phones, Now with Live Video","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.attvideoshare.com/""><img alt=""attlogo.png"" class=""shot"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/attlogo.png"" style=""float:left;""/></a>At the NXTcomm trade conference this morning AT&amp;T Chairman Randall Stephenson announced <a href=""http://www.attvideoshare.com/"">live video sharing</a> on their 3G enabled handsets.

The functionality is based on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Multimedia_Subsystem"">Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem</a> and runs on compatible phones such as the Samsung A717, Samsung Sync, and LG CU500v.  Stephenson also said you can expect to see them reach the other two screens as well.</p>, <p>The launch has some restrictions, though. It’s currently available in three markets: Atlanta, Dallas, and San Antonio. Only one phone can stream video at a time, and it’s also a bit pricey. You can pay per minute at 35 cents a minute or buy in bulk at $4.99 for 25 minutes (19.96 cents/min) or 60 minutes for $9.99 (16.65 cents/min).

Blind Camera Takes Other Peoples Photos,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""right"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/buttonstext1.jpg""/></p>, <p>Here’s a pretty neat concept dreamed up by an artist/student named Sascha Pohflepp based in Berlin.  His new project, named the Blind Camera doesn’t take pictures.  It does take a record of what time you pressed its big red button.  Then, it goes to the internet and searches for pictures taken at that same time.  Maybe an hour later, or a couple of weeks later, when somebody uploads their picture that they took when you pressed the button, it will show up on the Blind Camera.  This way, you become a part of a larger community.  The pictures you see belong to the person that took them, and you because you know what you were doing when that picture was taken.</p>, <p>It’s really just a Sony-Ericsson K750i with some custom software, a cool case and a neat-looking button.  It may not be the most useful tool invented this year, but I really like the concept of looking at pictures taken at the same time I was doing something important.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.blinksandbuttons.net/buttons_en.html"">The Blind Camera</a> [Blinks And Buttons via <a href=""http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/008974.php"">We Make Money Not Art</a>]</p>]"

Let’s Buy Some Music: Part 1,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>We’ve analyzed the services that sell digital music (iTunes and its competitors). This Part 1 focuses on the pay-per-download services. In Part 2 (<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/04/11/subscription-music-services-compared-part-2/"">now posted</a>) we’ll compare the all-you-can-eat subscription services.</p>, <p>While compact disc sales have declined 19 percent since 2001, online music sales have started to boom. According to a recent <a href=""http://www.ifpi.org/site-content/press/20060119.html"">report</a> by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, revenues from digital music sales almost tripled in the last year, to $1.1 billion in 2005. Apple’s iTunes accounted for over 85 percent of the single song downloads, but Apple is not alone in the online music space.</p>, <p>Legal downloads now account for about 6% of record companies’ revenues, up from practically zero two years ago.</p>, <p>We’ve signed up for just about every music download and subscription site out there and prepared a two part feature and pricing comparison of the best. We’ve divided the sites into “rent” v. “buy”. <strong>“Rent”</strong> sites are subscription based, all-you-can-eat services where you get to listen to all music in the catalog as long as you continue to pay the monthly fee. <strong>“Buy”</strong> sites are pay-per-download services, like iTunes, where you can also burn the song to a CD, and then rip the CD back to a computer and strip out any digital rights management (DRM) restrictions.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/downloadmusictable.png""/></p>, <p>There are eleven total sites that sell downloadable, CD-burnable music. However, two of these sites, <a href=""http://aol.musicnow.com/"">AOL Music Now</a> and <a href=""http://www.virgindigital.com/"">Virgin Digital</a>, require a paid subscription to their all-you-can-eat service in order to download songs (downloads cost an additional $0.99 each on both services). We’ve therefore left them out of the comparison chart.</p>, <p>Another, <a href=""http://www.emusic.com"">eMusic</a>, is focused on independent labels, and we’ve removed it from the comparison even though it offers DRM-free music at an attractive price ($0.25 per song). eMusic is an awesome service – the side by side table comparision didn’t give it the credit it deserves.</p>, <p>The remaining eight services are <a href=""http://www.allofmp3.com"">AllofMP3</a>, <a href=""http://www.buymusic.com"">BuyMusic</a>, <a href=""www.itunes.com"">iTunes</a>, <a href=""http://music.msn.com"">MSN Music</a>, <a href=""http://www.napster.com/"">Napster Light</a>, <a href=""http://www.rhapsody.com/"">Real Rhapsody</a>, <a href=""http://www.walmart.com/music"">Walmart.com</a> and <a href=""http://music.yahoo.com/unlimited"">Yahoo Music Unlimited</a>.</p>, <p>All but iTunes use the Windows Media Audio (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Audio"">WMA</a>) file format. iTunes supports the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding"">AAC</a> format. The only reason this is important is that Apple iPods won’t play WMA files, and non-iPods can’t play the iTunes AAC format. So your selection may largely be determined by which music player you choose to use.</p>, <p>The choice for best overall service is dead simple. <strong>The best service by far is AllofMP3.com.</strong> Music costs $0.02 per MB (about 9 cents per song at medium quality levels), and it can be downloaded in any common audio format and quality level. It is so cheap and easy to use that many people choose to download music from AllofMP3 in lieu of ripping their own CD collection.</p>, <p>The problem is that AllofMP3 operates under a different set of rules (Russian copyright law) than the rest of the companies. The service has been around for years and has many loyal users; however, its continued existence is in question. Some people have ethical concerns with using the service since no money makes its way back to the artists or labels.</p>, <p>Of the remaining services, the first question is what music player you will use. <strong>If you want to use an iPod, you need to use iTunes</strong> (or AllofMP3). If you want to use a non-iPod device, any of the others will work. The clear winner of the non-iTunes services is Real Rhapsody. They have one of the largest selections of music, quickly include new music, and have the cleanest user interface on the store. Rhapsody also has the highest quality downloads, at 192 kbps.</p>, <p>At $0.99 per song, though, Rhapsody is not the cheapest provider. That honor goes to BuyMusic at $0.79 per song. If you are price sensitive, BuyMusic may be the best choice for you.</p>, <p>Additional comparison information for all services is included in the table above.</p>]"

Thus content can come from various sources, including YouTube, MySpace and Metacafe and downloaded from Clippz.com to a computer, then “sideloaded” onto a mobile device in the appropriate optimized format.

JAJAH Introduces Free Global Calling That Isn’t Skype,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""jajah.jpg"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/jajah.jpg""/>Could a Skype killer be on the horizon? Possibly, according to the developers at JAJAH. The company has announced its No Headset campaign, and Web site, with the slogan “You Liked Skype, You’ll Love JAJAH.” This campaign is being launched to increase public awareness for the JAJAH service, and users are being rewarded with official clothing if they “creatively dispose of their existing computer headset.” Examples can be viewed on a special Web site that has been launched that provides program details, and includes videos of such “creativity.”</p>, <p>“JAJAH is revolutionary because it lets you make free and low-cost global calls using your everyday mobile or landline phone,” said Roman Sharf, JAJAH co-founder. “Services like Skype require headsets, software downloads and sometimes other technical equipment, making them way too hard for the everyday consumer to use.”</p>, <p><strong>As a side note:</strong> In fairness there are plenty of options for using Skype without a headset, including a new dual-use Philips VoIP phone that can be used as a traditional wireless phone, and as a Skype phone. More importantly as a Skype phone the Philips VOIP8411B/37 can even be used without a computer. It only requires a broadband connection and will work with dynamic and static IP address. I’ve been using it for the past week, and it is an excellent landline and Skype phone.</p>, <p>What JAJAH is doing is also very interesting. From the Web site, JAJAH lets callers enter their cell or landline phone number, along with the number they wish to call and JAJAH connects both parties. These calls are then free between JAJAH users for up to 30 minutes a day, and this includes calls to across town or across the planet.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.noheadset.com"">No Headset</a><br/>

To test it, I fired up my old PC, installed the 5 MB application, and downloaded the World News and San Francisco web packs. You can also ask Webaroo to index specific websites for offline viewing. I added TechCrunch.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Then I unplugged from the net and tried it out. The webpacks were great, allowing me to search or browse content. I would love this on a plane. The specific website index didn’t work out so well – all formatting and CSS was stripped from the page and the site looked horrible. Still, the content was there.</p>, <p>Webaroo also allowed me to choose to index the content linked to from the site, so links from TechCrunch were also viewable.

Subscription Music Services Compared: Part 2,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>We’ve analyzed the services that sell digital music and are presenting the results in a two part post. This Part 2 compares the subcription music services that let you access an entire music library of up to 2 million songs for a single monthly fee. <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/04/07/lets-buy-some-music-part-1/"">Part 1, posted last Thursday</a>, focused on the pay-per-download services (such as iTunes).</p>, <p>While the pay per download market is dominated by Apple iTunes and the quasi-legal AllofMP3, the subscription music market is a more level playing field. There are strong product offerings from <a href=""http://aol.musicnow.com/"">AOL</a>, <a href=""http://www.napster.com/"">Napster</a>, <a href=""http://www.rhapsody.com/"">Rhapsody</a>, <a href=""http://www.virgindigital.com/"">Virgin</a> and <a href=""http://music.yahoo.com/unlimited"">Yahoo</a>.</p>, <p>All of these services offer a music library of at least a million songs to users for a set monthly fee. The product offerings are generally broken down into three main buckets: PC listening only, “to go” which allows moving music to a music device, and an optional download service to allow permanent ownership of the song (with DRM) and that can be burned to a CD.</p>, <p>Note that none of these services work with an iPod. They all utilize Microsoft’s <a href=""http://www.playsforsure.com/"">PlayForSure</a> DRM technology which is not compatible with the iPod. Also, none of these services work on a Mac. You must have a Windows machine to use them, although Rhapsody has some Mac functionality.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/subscriptionmusictable.gif""/></p>, <p><strong><br/>
Overall, the best service based on pure stats is <a href=""http://www.virgindigital.com/"">Virgin Digital</a></strong>, which boasts the largest catalog of music (2 million songs) and the best overall price at $8/month. Unlike all of the other services, Virgin charges one price for both the PC and to go versions. Virgin also has excellent additional features like user reviews of music create a social atmosphere.</p>, <p>All of the services require the download and use of a special player, except AOL, which uses a web based approach along with the Windows Media Player.</p>, <p><strong>For the flat out cheapest price, Yahoo comes in at the lowest point</strong> with a basic plan of $5 per month (althought the to go plan is $10/month, higher than Virgin’s single price plan).</p>, <p>But based on pure joy of the user experience, <strong>Rhapsody has the slickest software and the most intuitive user interface.</strong> It’s the most expensive at $15/month, but worth the money if you want the best service available.</p>, <p>Both Google and Amazon are in the process of developing online music products, and will certainly have compelling product offerings of their own.</p>]"

Similarly, I use <a href=""http://sm2.techrigy.com/main/"">SM2</a> everyday to monitor news about CrunchBase. Currently I get a daily e-mail, but it’d be nice if I could subscribe to a password-protected RSS feed.</p>, <p>On Monday, Marshall Kirkpatrick claimed <a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/rip_enterprise_rss.php"">enterprise RSS is dead</a>–citing Newsgator’s continued infusion of cash as evidence the market is dead. Brad Feld responded with his thoughts on <a href=""http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2009/01/enterprise-rss-at-newsgator-is-alive-and-well.html"">why enterprise RSS is alive</a>.</p>, <p>Yesterday, I spoke with JB Holston, Newsgator’s CEO, and asked him for his thoughts:</p>, <p>You’re known for RSS readers–what problem do you want to be known for solving?</p>, <p>First, though our brand is associated with consumer RSS readers–FeedDemon, NetNewsWire, iPhone RSS reader–we never intended to build a consumer-focused product and flip it to Google. From the beginning, we were targeting the enterprise.</p>, <p>We want to be known for solving collaboration problems. We have social widgets, for example <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/tools/widgets"">Reuters widgets</a> use our technology. We also have a Social Sites application that basically turns Microsoft SharePoint into Facebook for the enterprise. [Screenshot below.]</p>, <p>Our enterprise RSS service has two sides: a Saas deployment used by approximately 150 vendors, and an on-premis server that sits behind the firewall–currently about 125 clients.</p>, <p>Why do you keep raising cash?</p>, <p>Newsgator was first funded four and half years ago–really, we’ve had three rounds of funding from separate groups. Technically it’s been six rounds, but only three events with different lead investors. So far we’ve raised $39 million.</p>, <p>This seems like a lot if we were just an iPhone developer (our iPhone application made TIME magazine’s top 10 list), but as I said before, we’re very focused on the enterprise. Raising $39 million is common in this space.</p>, <p>What’s your response on the death of enterprise RSS?</p>, <p>Who cares? It doesn’t have to be called enterprise RSS because that’s just the backend protocol. From our perspective, enterprise RSS–whether deployed for CMS, or portal enhancement, or social computing, or replaicing external information sources–is just the enabling technology.</p>, <p>Our customer’s don’t come to us and say “we want enterprise RSS”. They come with specific problems like “fix our portal”, “help us drive collaboration”, etc, and then we go use RSS. They don’t care how it happens.</p>, <p>From our point of view, the conversation has moved beyond RSS in the blogosphere. It’s a little startling to see people saying “because enterprise startups require cash, the enterprise RSS market is dead.”</p>, <p>RSS is fabulous technology, and if no one is talking about it, that’s just because the market matured to emphasizing solutions, not technologies.</p>, <p>It’s certainly an interesting argument, but I don’t think the market’s moved into understanding the power of enterprise RSS.</p>, <p>Maybe we’re just too stuck with bad inbox habits to worry about disentangling news from our inboxes. Certainly we’re just beginning to use online collaboration without having to think about it. Only time will tell how deeply RSS penetrates the enterprise.</p>, <p><a href=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/newsgator_socialsites_public_profile2.gif""><img alt="""" class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-1263"" height=""434"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/newsgator_socialsites_public_profile2-620x434.gif"" title=""newsgator_socialsites_public_profile2"" width=""620""/></a></p>]"

They have fairly robust tools for creating a coupon on the site, or advertisers can upload an existing offer. Coupons can be targeted locally or nationally, and there are other great features like “pause” to allow an advertiser to pull a coupon during busy periods. The eventual revenue model is to charge $0.50 per coupon printed (or click to an online offer) once they begin charging.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>Users can find coupons via search or browse on the site, or receive email or RSS alerts for the location and/or coupon categories of their choice.

Senate Proposes New ESRB Legislation,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""right"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/esrb.jpg""/></p>, <p>The Truth in Video Game Rating Act, proposed by Senator Sam Brownback, requires the ESRB to actually play the fully completed game. Currently, ESRB rates the game based on a video demonstration given to them by the developers. Just for the record, I’ve never once played a violent or non-violent game and decided the ESRB rating was inappropriate. Brownback also stated, “It would also prohibit video game producers and distributors from withholding or hiding playable content from a ratings organization”. Hiding or withholding playable content? If a game demonstration has a strong amount of violence, it automatically puts the game in to a M-rating. What we don’t see, are A-rated (Adults Only) games. Maybe that’s what Brownback wants?</p>, <p>
On top of the new requirement, Brownback’s bill would also require the Federal Trade Commission to specifically define parameters for describing game content and what would count as a mischaracterization of a game’s content. The current video game ratings system needs improvement because reviewers do not see the full content of games and don’t even play the games they are supposed to rate. For video game ratings to be meaningful and worthy of a parent’s trust, the game ratings must be more objective and accurate.
</p>, <p>Mom just didn’t know that <i>Hitman: Blood Money</i> was about a hired assassin! On top of that, the ESRB is also being watched over by the Government Accountability Office to rate the performance of the group and look into alternative systems of game ratings. Yikes! The ESRB must be facing some serious pressure now. Don’t be suprised if the new <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> faces some serious heat before it’s released.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11030"">New ESRB Legislation</a> [gamasutra]</p>]"

Shopify Was Worth the Wait,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.shopify.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>Ottawa-based <a href=""http://www.shopify.com"">Shopify </a>launched a lot later than <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/01/04/shopping-20/"">originally promised</a> (last fall), but it was worth the wait. They’ve launched a private beta and plan to open their doors permanently in May.</p>, <p>Shopify is a hosted ecommerce solution with integrated payments. People who sell stuff online, or want to, are going to like it. You can set up a store in moments, add items to sell, upload images, add tags and group items, and integrate paypal or a credit card processor for payments. Reporting is excellent, and they’ve even thought to include a RSS feed of recent orders to keep track of sales.</p>, <p>See <a href=""https://checkout.shopify.com/services/signup"">here</a> for more details on features. In general, sellers will be able to create a very professional multi-page website with little or no programming skills in just a few minutes.</p>, <p>There are a number of pre-made themes for the shop, and themes can be modified by directly manipulating the CSS. Shopify has also released a product called <a href=""http://vision.shopify.com/"">Vision</a>, which is a downloadable client application for designers to build and modify their own shopify shop themes.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Creating a store is free. Shopify takes a 3.75% commission on all sales.</p>, <p>So Shopify will help you set up a very nice store at a reasonable price. But they should quickly build tools to help people promote these stores as well (<a href=""http://shop.vendio.com/my/shop/promo_st.html"">Vendio</a>, for example, has some basic promotional tools, and they also assist with ebay listings).

PepperPad 3 Hands-On,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""center"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/IMG_3420.jpg""/><br/>
<img class=""right"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/bug2.jpg""/>The PepperPad 3 is a kitchen computer. Unlike previous versions, and multiple tablets that litter the slate-form-factor fields of battle, it’s not trying to be anything more than a handy device for looking up a recipe or two, listening to some Internet radio and maybe popping on a little prerecorded daytime TV or some in-bathroom web browsing.<br/>
<span id=""more-1271""></span></p>, <p><img class=""center"" src=""http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k90/crunchgear/IMG_3422.jpg""/><br/>
It’s about as big as a paperback book and runs an AMD Geode 533-Mhz processor. The device we received had 20GB of disk space and 256MB memory. The pad weighs about two pounds and is clad in rubberized plastic that makes for a nice grip. The touchscreen is acceptably sensitive and the split keyboard, while annoying at first, grows on you. There’s also a webcam, directional pad, and little scroll wheel. In all, it fits quite nicely in the hand and feels substantial enough to survive a fall from the kitchen counter.</p>, <p>Right now the applications are fairly basic. There’s a video player and an audio player along with an email client and an AIM client. All of the applications are accessible from the bottom of the screen, in tabs, or from the main icon screen. Most of the media is stored on disk—a fairly nasty thing—but you can also sync with Windows desktops using PepperPad’s desktop application. There is no visible way to add a network share drive but you can connect an external USB drive to drag and drop content onto the pad.</p>, <p>As a happy Nokia 770 user, I like to compare devices like the PepperPad—devices that are mainly “Internet tablets” rather than “laptops without keyboards” like the UMPC junk we’ve been seeing—to Nokia’s diminutive tablet. The PepperPad holds up quite favorably in that it is specifically designed with folks who wouldn’t use a laptop. It’s rugged, easy to use and small enough to hide out of the way when not in use. That said, it is also a <a href=""http://www.pepperhacks.com/"">hacker’s dream</a> and costs a mere $699 on <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Pepper-Pad-Web-Player-Black/dp/B000G0OKFU/sr=8-3/qid=1159455714/ref=pd_bbs_3/002-9907154-2377638?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics"">Amazon</a>, about the same as the 770. Thanks to its Linux base, it can run almost any Linux app.</p>, <p>Why should you get a PepperPad rather than a laptop? If Mom needs a computer for her recipes, email and maybe some AIM and Mom is of the Greatest Generation and doesn’t want one of those computer viruses, this is the answer. If gramps wants to listen to the local classical station in the basement and maybe download woodworking patterns, well, by gum, here you go. And if you want to browse the web from your couch and then drop this thing on the floor next to you when you doze off, this is your device.</p>, <p>If you want to get any work done, go get a laptop. If you want something that’s instant on, has an acceptable form factor and will, in time, ensconce itself into your life, then take a look at the PepperPad 3.</p>]"

iPhone Round-up,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" class=""left"" src=""http://old.crunchgear.com/wp-content/uploads/iphonedock.png""/>I was tired of hearing about the iPhone weeks ago. Nevertheless, the march towards 6pm goes on. The folks at our sister site are working feverishly to get you every single possible angle on people waiting in lines. Just kidding.

The constant coverage on the Internet about Apple’s new gizmo is long past the ‘overboard’ stage. When is enough enough? The iPhone isn’t ending world hunger. It’s a gadget. Is it big news for the mobile and consumer electronics industries? Yes.

Comparing the Mapping Services,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>Online mapping has come a long way in the last year. <a href=""http://maps.google.com"">Google Maps</a> entered the field and added satellite imagery to spring itself into the spotlight – challenging the colorful cartoon-like map images of longtime mapping frontrunner <a href=""http://www.mapquest.com"">Mapquest</a>. The Google Maps API enabled developers to create new applications and mashups, thereby pushing the Google Maps brand to mainstream audiences. Microsoft, Yahoo and others quickly followed.</p>, <p>As popular as Google is, it is not the most well trafficked map service. It is virtually tied with <a href=""http://maps.yahoo.com"">Yahoo Maps</a> (and the new <a href=""http://maps.yahoo.com/beta"">Yahoo Maps</a> beta product which <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/11/02/new-yahoo-maps-shows-power-of-flash/"">we reviewed here</a>). <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/home/digitalentertainment/2006/04/13/google-aol-yahoo-cx_rr_0417maps.html"">Comscore says</a> that Google Maps had 19.1 million unique visitors in March, whereas Yahoo had 20 million. Both were dwarfed by Mapquest, with a whopping 46.4 million unique visitors in March, more than Yahoo and Google combined.</p>, <p>In addition to Google Maps, Yahoo Maps and Mapquest, two others, <a href=""http://maps.ask.com"">Ask Maps</a> and <a href=""http://local.live.com"">Microsoft Windows Live Local</a>, also have compelling offerings.</p>, <p>We looked at all five of the current map services and examined their features and performance. Below is a feature by feature comparison.</p>, <p>The best? Yahoo Maps, for many reasons. More below.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/mapstable1.gif""/></p>, <p>All the major map sites offer two or more different viewing options, including a satellite view, except Mapquest. All the other sites have hybrid views overlaying map information onto a satellite image. Google, Ask and Yahoo also offer a pure satellite image. Windows Live Local boasts one of the more interesting views called bird’s eye view, which adds a 3D dimension to the map image — a sexy feature, though its value lies more in dazzle factor than usability:</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/livebirdview.gif""/></p>, <p>The zoom feature is a recognizable characteristic in most mapping services. Ask, Google and Windows Live Local all tied for the title of “Zoom Champion.” To determine the champ we performed a zoom test which focused on a single landmark and zoomed in as much as the application would allow. We then compared the five zoom levels to see which application allowed us to zoom in the most. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, check out our results below.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/zoomcomp.gif""/></p>, <p>Yahoo Maps has the best product for obtaining basic driving directions. Its Flash interface offers both <strong>multi-point directions</strong> and <strong>live traffic information</strong>. Want the directions sent to your <strong>cell phone</strong>? Click a button, enter the number and you have them. Yahoo also has a very responsive interface. Taking into account all of these factors, it’s the best for personal use.</p>, <p>Ask Maps allows multipoint directions, and Mapquest will send directions to your phone, but no other service offers both. And Yahoo alone offers live traffic information.</p>, <p>Ask Maps appeared to load a little slower than Yahoo and Google. Ask.com does offer a notable directions feature called Auto-Drive which animates the entire route. Unfortunately, Ask.com was the only service that provided inaccurate directions in our driving directions test.</p>, <p>With Window Live Local the route from point-to-point is not marked with a line like its competitors. This made it difficult to see the actual route. Contrastingly, the service introduces a pushpin feature enabling viewer-determined points on a map. This feature also is a social twist as pushpin points of interest can be saved and shared with others via another feature called a scratch pad.</p>, <p>Offering an API has become an invaluable marketing resource. The resulting mashup applications offer free marketing and buzz around a web 2.0 product. Mashups aside, mapping solutions in commercial use can have the same affect.</p>, <p>Google sports the most popular map API and is used in a number of applications such as <a href=""http://www.ning.com"">Ning</a>, <a href=""http://www.communitywalk.com"">CommunityWalk</a> and others.</p>, <p>Google’s API isn’t the best, but it is <a href=""http://www.programmableweb.com/tag/mapping"">by far</a> the most used service for mashups.</p>, <p>Expect that to change somewhat over time. Yahoo offers the widest selection of map development APIs (both Flash and Ajax). And recently, <a href=""http://www.zillow.com"">Zillow </a>, with its fuzzy number Zestimates, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/04/13/zillow-goes-3d/"">incorporated the relatively new bird’s eye view</a> offered by Windows Live Local via the Virtual Earth API.</p>, <p>Mapquest also has recently featured an open API and even prodded developers to take action by creating a developers challenge <a href=""http://www.mapquest.com/features/main.adp?page=developer_tools_oapi_devchallenge"">contest</a>. Amazon’s <a href=""http://maps.a9.com/"">A9 Map Beta</a> is a notable Mapquest implementation since it associates street level images with streets on a map to produce a unique mapping experience.</p>, <p>Yahoo is the only service with mapping on <a href=""http://mobile.yahoo.com/home"">web-enabled mobile devices</a> without a download. Google Local <a href=""http://www.google.com/glm/index.html"">Mobile Beta</a> is a free downloadable mapping application, but it does not work on every mobile device or carrier. <a href=""http://company.mapquest.com/mqws/2.html"">Mapquest Mobile </a> is a subscription model which starts at $3.99 per month, but access to this service is also contingent on your mobile carrier and device.</p>, <p>Mapquest is the most popular mapping service but lags on features and usability. Google is the most notable and has a ubiquitous API. Windows Live Local dazzles with its creative views and features but falls short of the others in direction functionality. Mapquest offers a number of features but still is missing satellite imagery, which makes it trail the competitors in core functionality. Ask Maps is a worthy competitor but had the highest error rate of the group.<br/>
<strong><br/>
Overall, Yahoo Maps was by far the best application tested.</strong> Its fast Flash interface, multipoint directions, live traffic information, and easy send-to-mobile feature make it the hands down winner. It also features the most robust API options.</p>]"

We’re convinced that it’s going to have an impact. When it comes down to it, it will drive consumer demand for wonderful, easy to use, cool services. It expands the art of the possible in the minds of consumers.</p>, <p>It makes all players in the industry say to themselves, “Hey, it’s absolutely possible to create compelling and intuitive applications.”</p>, <p><strong>Mobile Crunch:</strong> Will its impact be lessened because of its high price point, i.e. would it have had a bigger impact at a lower SRP?</p>, <p><strong>Rege:</strong> iPhone is a high end device right now. Over time, price points can change. We’ve seen this across the board in other technologies. It’s fair to say the price points will evolve. At Yahoo, we want to see these types of platforms going to as many people as possible.</p>, <p><strong>Mobile Crunch:</strong> How will the iPhone affect mobile advertising? How will the iPhone’s unique Web browsing method affect the ads or types of ads Yahoo sells on its space?</p>, <p><strong>Rege:</strong> There are three components to this.</p>, <p>1. Anything that drives people to mobile data services is good. That creates more critical mass to be able to sell advertising into.</p>, <p>2. At Yahoo, we don’t build the same experience for all phones. We optimize our services on different phone platforms. Anything that lets us do more stuff also opens the door for more advertisers.</p>, <p>3. The single most important thing is: You’ve gotta have the ability to make advertising <em>relevant</em> to the user. Simple ads with high relevance are highly effective.</p>, <p><strong>Mobile Crunch:</strong> That’s a natural seque to Yahoo SmartAds.</p>, <p><strong>Rege:</strong> The high level concept of SmartAds is: Use the stuff you know about the user to customize the ad. We’re using personalization to target ads more readily. Everything we’re doing in SmartAds for the PC platform is applicable to mobile–we’re not limited by media type.</p>, <p>In all our services, we’re moving towards personalization–that is, making sure we can provide services tailored for the user and the platform. Make sure the services actually <em>matter </em>to them.</p>, <p><strong>Mobile Crunch:</strong> Can we look down the road and ask what kind of trends will we see in advertising or mobile two years or even a year from now? Or is technology moving too fast to make predictions like that?</p>, <p><strong>Rege:</strong> New technology like the iPhone opens up the door to a lot of people to say, “Wow, I can do a lot of cool stuff on my phone; it’s more than just voice and text.” We’re going to see a transition as users realize this lifeline they have—the phone—is also relevant for a lot of the things they want to do in the world. As I mentioned before, it expands the art of the possible in the minds of consumers. That brings a lot of folks in and creates a lot more demand for advertising. This whole notion of increasing demand by expanding what users can do with the technology drives how we look to deliver our services.</p>, <p><strong>Mobile Crunch:</strong> How is measuring mobile advertising metrics different from standard Internet ad reporting and measurement?</p>, <p><strong>Rege:</strong> When you’re an advertiser creating a mobile campaign, do you want it a brand extension of what you’re doing on the PC? People are experimenting. This is very early market. The standard metrics: impressions, conversion—these are applicable to mobile. The core metrics will be the same but the expanded metrics will be different. Mobile is ripe for experimentation.</p>, <p><strong>Mobile Crunch:</strong> Do you expect the user metrics to change as mobile technologies become accessible to more people?</p>, <p><strong>Rege:</strong> As mobile usage becomes more mass market, the nature of things people do will change. Our mobile offerings are global. Each country is in a different stage of evolution. In the United States, we have so many different ways of connecting: high broadband penetration, high PC penetration. A lot of countries in Southeast Asia don’t have those options. In many areas, people don’t have another option to do them. We have to have a product that doesn’t rely on a user having access to a PC. We have to provide service in a mobile-first context.</p>, <p><strong>Mobile Crunch:</strong> Are we moving towards a standardization in the way mobile gadgets view the web? Or is the speed of technology moving companies in different directions?</p>, <p><strong>Rege:</strong> There might be some day when we have true standardization, but I’m not sure how old I will be. We’re not going to hold our breath. We believe the world will continue to be fragmented on the OS and browser side.</p>, <p><strong>Mobile Crunch:</strong> What does Yahoo see as the biggest challenge in the mobile marketplace?<br/>
<strong>Rege:</strong> Helping users figure out what’s possible. Sometimes this industry gets too caught up in technology. The key is finding simple, compelling applications.</p>, <p>If I had one wish about driving usage to the mobile platform, it would be to come up with great ways for users to understand what they can do on the phone and provide services to them in a way that is not complicated.</p>]"

Too Much of Nothing,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a class=""shot2"" href=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/basementtapes_0.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-1294"" height=""300"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/basementtapes_0.jpg"" title=""basementtapes_0"" width=""300""/></a>I’ve been reading an interesting quasi-history of the Basement Tapes, a series of recordings produced in a garage in Woodstock, New York in 1967 by Bob Dylan and the group that soon came to be known as The Band. It’s quasi-history because of the participants; Dylan won’t comment, Richard Manuel and Rick Danko are dead, and Levon Helm only showed up for the last few sessions at the end of that summer.</p>, <p>The one common thread is that the recordings were not meant to see the light of day, except as a publishing tape to be distributed privately to encourage covering by other artists. This was eminently successful, with a number of songs hitting the pop charts from people like Peter, Paul, and Mary and Manfred Mann. What fascinates me about the fragmentary recounting of the tale is the process by which Dylan and his collaborators produced a secret body of work that was injected into the cultural dialog not in opposition to but alternatively to the high production of the Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper.</p>, <p>40-some years later, the technology process is similarly roiled by the intersection, or as some insist the collision, of the last and next paradigms of the Internet revolution. The roles of Dylan and The Band, then called the Hawks, are played by Twitter, FriendFeed, Ustream, the iPhone, and so on. Where the Basement Tapes were recorded in a circle of musicians trading off between instruments and vocals, the real time Web as it is colloquially becoming known employs a variety of lightweight tools to orchestrate a rich, deceptively simple platform.</p>, <p>Sgt. Pepper was recorded over 8 months employing hundreds of hours of Abbey Road studio time, engineers, and elaborate experiments in expanding the envelope of recording and performance technology. The Basement Tapes were done with the equivalent of prosumer equipment and the careful placement of at most 6 microphones. Curiously, an additional microphone dangled in the middle of the circle, to be picked up by various participants and used to interject Voice-of-God humorous pronouncements into the proceedings. With apologies to Dave Winer and Adam Curry, these were the first podcasts.</p>, <p>Last week Neil Young filmed a video in his house with Ustream and released it on YouTube. Young sent email to a friend with the URL on the 9th, and the video spread over the next several days. The song he performed is part of Young’s next record, to be released in March (assuming it goes according to current plan.) A few days ago, David Sanborn and I filmed an iChat session between two MacBook Airs which was edited down to 10 minutes with iMovie and uploaded to YouTube. It took some 15 hours to become available directly on the iPhone. Days and then hours.</p>, <p>Tonight Ustream has released an AppStore download allowing anyone with a Webcam to broadcast in effective realtime over a WiFi connected iPhone<del datetime=""2009-01-20T08:42:47+00:00""> or iPod Touch</del>. With an open source piece of Mac software, it’s trivial to project a video onto a Ustream channel, initiate a broadcast, Tweet the show URL, and reduce the latency from hours to minutes. We’ve been <a href=""http://friendfeed.com/search?q=Sanborn+in+Paradise&amp;who=everyone"">experimenting</a> with these techniques to film recording sessions in New York, rehearsals in Tokyo, and improvisations on vacation in the Caribbean. Sometimes the quality of the broadband deteriorates or drops out, but then some of the Basement Tapes were recorded at the lowest possible speed over other takes on cheap tape stock.</p>, <p>I could connect the dots between these “experiments” and the startup world, the IT dialectic, the usual rationalizations for something that needs no such explanation. Soon we will tire of recounting the story of how events are transmitted faster and unfiltered over the real time network and realize that discovery happens when it happens, when the stars and minds align, when the cost of production approaches zero and the real investment is in the ideas being captured and distributed.</p>, <p>On the Basement Tapes you can hear the players melding into a supple machine, the laboratory that produced the group known as The Band when producer John Simon took the lightning captured in the garage and supplemented it with color and better application of technology. What wasn’t lost was the sound, the mesh if you will, that was invented in the garage. Steve Wozniak was quoted a few days ago as suggesting that Steve Jobs’ withdrawal from day to day operations at Apple might give him the time to visualize the future. I’m paraphrasing, but often the role of producer is to encourage but not smother when the take or feel emerges.</p>, <p>The economic crisis tests our mettle, but it also produces the limitations of a canvas from which rare results emerge. Boil down all the noise about real time and you get a common dilemma — <a href=""http://www.bobdylan.com/#/songs/too-much-nothing"">too much of nothing</a>, as one of the Basement Tapes famously called the firehose. How you separate the wheat from the chaff, find the trusted voices, harness the beat of the times — these are the valuable things that minutes or days or years later we’ll look back on and understand how everything had to go right to bring us to the moment tomorrow morning when a black man becomes a leader when we need it most.</p>]"

"While the BBC fiddles, Britain's innovation burns","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""shot2"" src=""http://uk.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/nero-2.jpg""/>Ok, so that might be a rather strong headline, but it was the best I could think of to describe what is currently going on. (That’s Nero fiddling while Rome burns, btw).</p>, <p>It’s no secret that I am <a href=""http://uk.beta.techcrunch.com/2008/04/14/with-highfield-gone-the-bbc-must-now-open-up/"">dissappointed</a> that the BBC has spent so much time and money trying to re-invent the wheel For The Glory of the Corporation. I think the BBC should do more, a LOT more, to hook into the innovation happening in technology companies in the private sector, and at the same time allowing private sector companies to innovate around the products the BBC produces. And that does not mean just commissioning more user interface design, or the odd microsite, from a bunch of agencies. If it did so, the BBC might even find some products it quite liked and <em>could use to make the BBC better</em>. Really. No kidding.</p>, <p>Yes, you can talk to me about Rights (“but we don’t have the release forms for that show’s music to be used online!” Yawn.) till the cows come home. That’s what the BBC should do. And I do not mean just organising another barcamp style <a href=""http://mashed08.eventbrite.com/"">event</a> for geeks to feel <a href=""http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/news/archives/2008/01/hack_day_2008_o.html"">warm and cuddly</a> about the Beeb (with apologies to those great guys over at <a href=""http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/"">BBC Backstage</a>).</p>, <p>I’m talking about turning the BBC into a platform that UK startup technology companies can work on and with.</p>, <p>Last week the BBC Trust’s review of Bbc.co.uk <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7425287.stm"">found the whole project</a> in a bit of a mess. The most succinct account of this is over at <a href=""http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/digitalcontent/2008/05/budgetbusting_bbccouk_threaten.html#comment-1133675"">PDA</a>. Here are the main points.:</p>, <p>• The BBC breached its 2007/2008 budget by a whopping 48%.</p>, <p>• Two-thirds of the £35.8m overspend was down to “misallocation of general overheads and costs” such as failing to include costs such as the buildings that house its digital teams. Oh yes.</p>, <p>• Who gets fired? No one. (Thats OK though – former digital head Ashley Highfield has already <a href=""http://uk.beta.techcrunch.com/2008/04/14/with-highfield-gone-the-bbc-must-now-open-up/"">jumped ship</a>).</p>, <p>• Will the spend go down? No. They are adding £4.4m extra and taking the baseline budget for 2007/2008 of £74.2m to £114.4m, a 54% increase. Trebles all round!</p>, <p>• This does not take into account the BBC’s £400m “future media” budget, so the BBC actually has £500m to spend on digital media. Imagine what you could do with that…</p>, <p>• The Trust recommended three new levels of “protections” aimed at better controlling the BBC’s digital ambition: stricter financial controls, clearer definition for what each part of the website aims to achieve and an “independent” assessment of market impact where competitors risk being “overwhelmed by the scale of the BBC.”</p>, <p>• These rivals could now appeal to this mythical “independent” panel – which is in fact overseen by the BBC Trust. But guess what – the panel would most likely take 18 months to two years to adjudicate. Any startup trying to enter this process would be dead before it got going.</p>, <p>Now, I am not going to weigh into the argument the commercial newspaper sector normally has with the BBC. That’s just dull. They should be innovating just like the rest of the startup sector does on the smell of an oily rag, rather than whining about the BBC’s competition.</p>, <p>But the best way the BBC can now allay any fears about its market dominance is by building a platform for innovation. Not a policy – a real platform. With APIs even.</p>, <p>That way we’ll get our money/value back – and the BBC can start to give something back, not just TV and radio programmes, but a real platform for UK startups to become world beaters.</p>, <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</p>, <p>I’m starting a list of links to the small number of people inside the BBC who “get it”</p>, <p>Here’s <a href=""http://derivadow.com/2008/04/16/highly-connected-graphs-opening-bbc-data/"">one</a>.

HP Officially Announces Purchase Of Voodoo PC,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""right""/><br/>
This is sort of out of nowhere for HP, but it just picked up Canadian boutique computer vendor Voodoo PC. HP made an attempt at building gaming desktops a couple years ago, but didn’t seem to put too much time or effort into that market segment and shortly dropped the venture altogether.</p>, <p>I’ve always liked Voodoo’s systems, despite their being pretty freakin’ costly and I’m a fan of HP’s desktops and notebooks as well. Voodoo is certainly a strong competitor to Alienware, which was purchased by Dell earlier this year. Now, does this mean Gateway is going to be shopping around for its own gaming system builder?<br/>
Full press release after the jump.</p>, <p><span id=""more-1302""></span>HP to Acquire VoodooPC</p>, <p>PALO ALTO, Calif., Sept. 28, 2006 – HP today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire VoodooPC, a leader in the design and manufacture of high-performance and personalized gaming computer systems.<br/>
Following the close of the transaction, HP will form a separate business unit within its Personal Systems Group focused on the gaming industry. VoodooPC co-owner Rahul Sood will become chief technologist for the unit and co-owner Ravi Sood will become the unit’s director of strategy.</p>, <p>Both executives will report to Phil McKinney, who will become general manager of the gaming business unit while maintaining his current role as chief technology officer of HP’s Personal Systems Group. This operational model will align the gaming business with HP’s research and development organization by providing access to the latest technologies and innovation.</p>, <p>Founded in 1991 and headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, VoodooPC has been dedicated to delivering leading-edge performance, style and craftsmanship to discerning PC enthusiasts. This acquisition, once closed, will extend HP’s presence into the high-performance gaming market and globally expand the reach of the VoodooPC brand.</p>, <p>“HP is already a market leader in two of the three major segments in the gaming market by providing industry-leading workstation solutions for game development and powering the largest online game services,” said Todd Bradley, executive vice president, Personal Systems Group, HP. “We’re absolutely thrilled to welcome VoodooPC, gaming industry pioneers and the premier name in gaming, to the HP team. Together with VoodooPC’s leadership and influence, HP will have the expertise to become the leader in the gaming customer segment.”<br/>
HP plans to maintain VoodooPC’s current distribution model and brand name along with its marketing, sales, support and development operations.</p>, <p>“Our passion at VoodooPC has been to design the highest performance, personalized PCs for our customers’ entertainment,” said Rahul Sood, founder and president, VoodooPC. “Customers should continue to expect the highest level of personalized configurations, service and quality. The benefits of this acquisition to VoodooPC are immense, not least of which is having a direct conduit to HP’s unparalleled innovation and international presence.”</p>]"
PayPal Mobile Checkout Lets You Pay While On the Go,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""paypal.jpg"" class=""right"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/paypal.jpg""/>As a frequent traveler, and eBay addict I’ve been faced with a small problem. I can watch the auctions for those rare vintage maps, international DVDs and other “junk” that fills my apartment from my mobile phone. I can even place bids for the items. But paying for the stuff was a pain. And many sellers have strange, and even demanding rules on how quickly they want to be paid. If I’m home I’m using checking out 30 seconds after an item ends, but when I’m on the road I’m panicking to get to a PC.</p>, <p>But the auction gods have answered my prayers! PayPal announced this week the launch of Mobile Checkout, a service that will allow users in the U.S., the U.K. and Canada to buy items securely using the mobile Web! PayPal Mobile works like the traditional payment and you can use a credit card or direct transfer from a bank to pay for auctions or other items.

It’s the behind the scenes photo and video server for MySpace, eBay and dozens of other sites that either have significant restrictions on photo/video uploads or heavy fees.

Photobucket is not designed to be a destination site – their tools are focused on easy uploading, transcoding to flash (in the case of video) and posting to other sites. 63% of all media links to sites like MySpace are served by Photobucket.

If you choose to use the competitor instead, you simply dial “1″ to redirect your call.</p>, <p>Another difference is that if there is no local advertiser for the business type you have requested, the business receiving the call hears a short message at the beginning of the call telling them that the call is via Free-411.

Here are the additional details he gives:</p>, <p>Here’s a better way of looking at it.  The AIM Buddy List (which was introduced 10 years ago) was the orignial social network, and it has 43 million AIM and Buddy List users.  We’re working on adding functionality to AIM that will really open it up — allowing developers, partners, and users to take part.  It’s going to be fun.  Rather than thinking of it as a killer of anything, let alone MySpace, it will allow our millions of users to express themselves in new and interesting ways and become a catalyst for new communities to grow and flourish.

You plug any one of the main units into a router, install software on your PC or Mac, and then plug other units in around the house where you want to play music. Point it to your music collection on your network, or use Rhapsody or the pre-selected internet radio stations. The ZP80 units are smaller and need to be plugged into some sort of amplified device – stereo system, computer, etc. The ZP100 units have an amplifier built in and can be plugged directly into speakers.</p>, <p>These are all interchangeable, you can use a ZP100 in one room, a ZP80 in another (which is what I have done). They are also modular, so you can add new components over time.</p>, <p>The controller works a lot like an iPod and has two features I’m using heavily.

Others can use this feedback to help them determine if they are doing business with someone who’d likely to engage in fraud. <strong>Rapleaf is eBay feedback for the rest of the web, and the offline world.</strong></p>, <p>There are three important things to understand about Rapleaf – the interface and basic feature set, fraud prevention and detection, and their API set and related policies.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/rapleaf4551.gif""/></p>, <p>Rapleaf allows any user to leave feedback for anyone (whether they are a user or not), based on a unique email address or phone number. Type that identifier into the search bar. If no results occur, you can be the first to leave feedback for that person. This can be someone you’ve bought or sold with, or just a friend that you want to endorse. Like eBay, a free-text area is included for comments in addition to a positive/neutral/negative rating.</p>, <p>A person’s feedback rating is a raw score, with a point added for a positive review and a point subtracted for a negative review (just like eBay). Non-transaction endorsements are calculated and shown separately. Various stats are calculated and displayed based on feedback ratings by others (see screen shot below).</p>, <p>eBay knows when two people have transacted. That removes a lot of fraud issues (although a big issues on eBay has been users selling thousands of low priced items to jack up their feedback and then engaging in fraud with high ticket items). Rapleaf won’t have this luxury, and so they are focused on preventing and detecting fraud in their system.</p>, <p>First, any feedback left of a user can be challenged. At first this will be handled by Rapleaf employees. Later, they will probably use a third party to handle disputes.</p>, <p>Rapleaf will also employ human and machine based analysis of all feedback to look for patterns that suggest fraud, particularly in boosting a feedback rating. A user can probably get a an extra point or two every few months without being detected. But co-founder Auren Hoffman tells me he’s confident that they will be able to detect any large scale fraud attempts and shut the offending account(s) down.</p>, <p>He won’t disclose his trade secrets, of course, and so I have no way of telling if he’s right. But if they’ve nailed this issue, the biggest one facing them, then they’ll have gone a long way to achieving success.</p>, <p>Rapleaf will (on launch) deploy an API to allow third parties to access the key parts of the service. Account creation, review creation and feedback scores will all be accessible, and free, to third parties who choose to integrate. For non-eBay shopping sites, Rapleaf will be a competitive leveler. And if enough sites start to integrate with Rapleaf over time, the data will become even more relevant than eBay’s.</p>, <p>If Rapleaf succeeds in their plans, it will make the Internet a better place to do business. And Rapleaf won’t be limited to online transactions – there is no reason that transactions occuring offline can’t be measured by Rapleaf as well. The fact that an identifier can also be a phone number tells me that Rapleaf is already thinking this way.</p>, <p>Business development will be an important area for Rapleaf to nail. Their APIs will spur countless mashups without a direct business deal. But I also expect to see some big retailers, classified sites and shopping engines integrate with Rapleaf over time. That will require a good business development team to search out and close those deals.</p>, <p><strong><br/>

Devshop Helps Deliver Better Software On Time,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.devshop.com""><img alt=""devshop logo"" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/devshop-logo.gif""/></a></p>, <p>Unlike the plethora of project management systems available today <a href=""http://www.devshop.com"">Devshop </a>stands out because it is focused on one thing – managing software development projects and assisting project managers with delivering quality software on time. Devshop was largely developed and founded by Ottawa, Canada based former developer and project manager Craig Fitzpatrick (who writes a great blog about project management theory and devshop at <a href=""http://www.uncommonsenseforsoftware.com/"">www.uncommonsenseforsoftware.com</a>). Devshop is in a private beta at the moment but I have been using it for the past few weeks (evaluating it for our own use).</p>, <p>Like many of us who are responsible for delivering software, Craig was frustrated with existing project management tools such as Microsoft Project as they were over-complicated and didn’t help in eliminating scheduling and other problems responsible for the fact that over 70% of software projects fail. Generic project management applications (such as <a href=""http://www.basecamphq.com"">Basecamp</a>) are very good for smaller-scale projects, or for other projects such as organizing a wedding, but are a let-down when it comes to managing teams of developers.</p>, <p>The idea behind Devshop is to really focus in on the unique risks that cause software projects to be late. The solution focuses on project management, quality management and requirements management. It takes care of the managerial aspects of a project rather than trying to be a source code control tool and everything else – project management on it’s own is very broad so having this focus from a product is very good.</p>, <p>When managing a project with DevShop you don’t set start dates for tasks, but rather you assign tasks to somebody and set a priority. Devshop will take care of scheduling from there based on when tasks are complete, their priority, dependencies and any constraints it may have. Managing time properly is crucial in software management and Devshop does a lot of this work for the project manager.</p>, <p>Devshop has taken an innovative approach to solving some of the pains of project management by using risk analysis which can gauge the impact changes to schedules have. With other solutions project schedules are often locked in after initial planning, which causes problems when there are delays or when tasks change (which always happens). Devshop allows your schedule to be more fluid and dynamic – and it will forecast the impact certain changes and delays will have allowing the project manager to plan accordingly or to undo changes. It will allow the project manager to plan properly by looking at different scenarios before locking them in, ie. changing the priority of a schedule or the order in which a particular developer approaches tasks.</p>, <p>Besides the intelligent logic, Devshop has a very nice interface that allows you to drag and drop tasks, use context menus and edit all variables in-line (it will dynamically redraw charts etc. – a very rich user experience). Users of other project management solutions should have no problem diving into Devshop and getting full use of it immediately. There are many help pages as well that cover both the basics as well as explaining some of the more advanced aspects. Craig’s previous project management experience comes across in the help pages as he offers tips and tricks to managing your projects more effectively and offering advice. It took me no longer than a few minutes (and just a single page refresh) to setup a project with a number of tasks and a schedule.</p>, <p>At the moment the private beta is of a basic version of the product, but by the time it launches there will be both basic and professional editions (with the professional edition you get more metrics, trends and predictions). The professional edition will also offer multiple views that are customized for different team members and roles (ie. A CEO’s view will be a general overview with scheduling etc.). Pricing is very reasonable and will start at $20 per month. Devshop is an easy to use and innovative solution that  will make project management easier for the 15 million software developers out there.

This will be used for product development, buying a gambling license from Malta (but of course) and conducting a private beta launch for summer of 2008 and a public launch Autumn of 2008. There’s an interesting twist – they plan to offer an open API for people to develop their own betting applications and use the Smarkets infrastructure. Their idea is this: users don’t need knowledge of odds or experience. It’s more about speed and entertainment than sports.</p>, <p>The main competition is big: <a href=""http://Betfair.com"">Betfair</a> is worth $3billion and there are other betting exchanges<br/>

Teamslide could disrupt WebEx,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.teamslide.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>Munich, Germany based <a href=""http://www.teamslide.com"">Teamslide</a> is a new and very low cost alternative to services like WebEx, Placeware and GotToMeeting that allow people to share applications (like power point) online.</p>, <p>A typical use of WebEx, Placeware, GoToMeeting, etc. is a sales call. The host, or presenter, sets up the call using WebEx software. The attendees click a link in an email at the scheduled time, and everyone is joined in a virtual meeting. The host is able to share applications (powerpoint, browser, pdf, Word, etc.) and make the pitch.</p>, <p>A drawback of all of the existing services is price and the need for browser plugins for both hosts and attendees. WebEx and Placeware both have minimum pricing of $375/month, and GoToMeeting is a minimum of $50/month. And anyone that has used these services knows that they kill you on usage fees, over and above the minimum prices.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Teamslide, which just launched, has many of the features of the other services, is much easier to use (no plugins or other software for host or attendees) and is a fraction of the price. The downside is that, at least in its current implementation, it requires a <a href=""http://www.teamslide.com/pages/check/check.php"">server-side software installation</a>.</p>, <p>The service requires only a browser for both host and attendees, has an Ajax interface and can be used to share presentation slides (in a proprietary Teamslide format). They’ve created a plugin for easy conversion from <a href=""http://www.teamslide.com/pages/take-a-tour/8-powerpointaddin.php"">powerpoint</a>. See more details of the service in their <a href=""http://www.teamslide.com/demo/demo9/admin/login.php?todo=load&amp;username=demo&amp;password=demo"">demo</a>.</p>, <p>Based on the demo (linked above), which is a live implementation of the service, Teamslide is significantly easier to use than WebEx (I’ve been the victim of many failed WebEx presentations). A clear limitation of Teamslide is that it only shares presentation slides, whereas WebEx really shines when sharing a browser and other applications. But until now the only real alternative to WebEx, besides an in person meeting, was emailing of files before the presentation. Services like Teamslide, as well as online versions of powerpoint like <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/09/thumbstacks-ajaxflash-web-powerpoint/"">Thumbstacks</a>, are starting to change that.</p>]"

It will mean other mobile startups with location as a feature will be looked at in a more favourable light.

It may also mean that the battle for location-based services has reached a peak, with startups now having to think about location being a “given” and then looking to create less commoditised services, like filtering, as Rummble does.</p>, <p>My industry sources are telling me that this was a smart acquisition for Nokia, which needed to have a consumer based offering outside the rigid maps infrastructure they have, since the purchase last year of Navteq.</p>, <p>There is also a local story here. The Plazes office is in Berlin, physically close to the Gate 5 people, and we know from good authority that Gate 5 people are highly respected on the Berlin scene. It’s therefore likely that they had a lot to do with the acquisition thinking inside Nokia as they know the guys from Plazes.</p>, <p>From what we know about Nokia, the purchase of Plazes fits in with their strategy in terms of context and location and what to do with it. Put together the Ad system they have, and they control a strong section of the mobile ecosystem from ad generation, delivery through branded channels, with good profile information about the user, especially since most new handsets from Nokia now have GPS built in.</p>]"
EU to Announce Standard for Mobile TV,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""euflag.jpg"" class=""right"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/euflag.jpg""/>One of the upsides for bringing all the nations of Europe under a single banner is that we’ve managed to see a (mostly) continental-wide currency, easier access between countries and more consistent standards when it comes to technology. OK, there are some holdouts, and a few nations that like to do their own thing (don’t change U.K., we love you just the way you are).</p>, <p><span id=""more-1351""></span></p>, <p>And while getting multiple nations to agree on certain standards isn’t easy, we’re already seeing some of the benefits. The latest of these could be the expected continent-wide standard for the delivery of television services to mobile phones. The current buzz is that EU media commissioner Viviane Reading may announce the Nokia and Motorola-supported DVB-H format for Europe-wide use. This isn’t even remotely unexpected, as DVB-H is already the most widely-adopted of the three mobile TV technologies currently used in the EU.</p>, <p>What is clear is that a world-wide standard won’t be happening anytime soon as DMB is widely used in South Korea and Japan, and as we reported yesterday <a href=""http://mobilecrunch.com/2007/07/16/indonesian-mobile-tv-based-on-dmb-technology/"">Indonesia is adopting the Digital Multimedia Broadcasting format</a> as well. In the United States we’re still tackling the situation, but don’t expect any such single format – we just like our choices too much it seems!</p>, <p>The issue in Europe is also far from resolved. Virgin Mobile could be a DMB-based technology holdout in the U.K., while rivals such as T-Mobile, O2 and Vodafone will likely support DVB-H.

"Sprint Launches loopt, First Social Mapping Service","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""loopt.jpg"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/loopt.jpg""/>Are your friends avoiding you? Are they really getting together without you? Well, Sprint probably didn’t have tracking in mind when they announced loopt, but this first-ever social mapping service on a major U.S. carrier will help you know if you’re being given the brush-off. More importantly it will help make sure you don’t miss your friends, as the service uses GPS capabilities on select Sprint handsets to facilitate real-world interaction between friends. You’ll now be able to share your location, and send proximity-based messages and view geo-tagged photos. OK, so this isn’t a way to track your buddies, but making sure you don’t miss each other is a good feature to have.</p>, <p>“The most common mobile question in the world is ‘Where are you?’ and we’re excited that loopt will be able to answer that question for Sprint customers who choose to participate,” said loopt chief executive officer and co-founder, Sam Altman. “The way we communicate on the mobile phone is about to change forever, as loopt on Sprint puts an end to missed connections and facilitates real-world interactions.”</p>, <p>The service can automatically update the location of everyone in a user’s private network of friends and display the info directly on a mobile map. loopt can also alert you to when a friend is near. The service is 100 percent permission-based, and this data is only available in private networks. So you’re not signing up to have big brother watch you, even if it sounds like that at first. It will be available on more than 25 Sprint and Nextel phones for $2.99 per month, along with standard data charges.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.sprint.com"">Sprint</a></p>]"

Well it seems obvious enough that texting while driving is a bad thing, it takes tragic events like the one last week to really bring the point home. The best rule of thumb should be to keep the thumbs on the steering wheel at all times, and avoid even touching the mobile handset.</p>, <p>But since a lot of people aren’t going to listen to this advice, we figured we try and recommend an alternative solution. One is E-Max from Virtual Management Inc. This month service ($19.95 per month) lets users flag VIP contacts so that when messages are sent via e-mail you can receive these most important messages as a voice message. You can then in turn replay via the phone, and the receiver will receive an e-mail with a voice attachment.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.evaforhire.com"">Electronic Virtual Assistant from Virtual Management</a></p>]"
Nodus Psyclone PSP Speaker Dock,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""center"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/9548_large.jpg""/></p>, <p>For those of you who own a PSP and want a mini home theater system with you on the go, the Psyclone PSP speaker dock is another PSP accessory to add to your list. The Psyclone features Sonic Impact’s Class T Amp Technology, which fills the room with extreme clarity at all frequencies. All the standards are also here: Remote control, built-in charger and TV-Out.

"Fluxiom: Great Product, Outrageously Priced","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.fluxiom.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a><a href=""http://www.fluxiom.com"">Fluxiom</a>, based in Vienna, is a first rate online storage and file management product. I’d even go so far as to say that it is the most usable storage product <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/01/31/the-online-storage-gang/"">I’ve tested</a>.</p>, <p>A key issue with online storage is the uploading function. Typically files are uploaded one at a time via a web interface, which is fine for just a file or two but breaks down under heavy usage. Flickr and some other sites have mitigated this problem by creating a desktop-based application that users can drag multiple files into. Sites that don’t have this are seriously limited in their ability to serve customers. Fluxiom has come up with a unique way to deal with the issue without a desktop uploader – by allowing users to zip up files and upload them all in one go. While this works in theory, and I was able to upload a zipped folder with multiple files, Fluxiom did not automatically unzip the folder and I could not determine a way to do it with the service.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>Fluxiom in general handles files extremely well. Uploaded files can be viewed by thumbnail or file name. Thumbnails can be resized with an Ajax slider (gimmicky but cool). Sharing, versioning and other features are all supported, as is tagging in a limited form (you must predefine tags beforehand, they cannot be created on the fly when uploading files. Fluxiom’s search is also very good.</p>, <p>So, on the product side, I have no complaints other than the issues I had with uploading zipped folders, and the desire to tag-on-the-fly.</p>, <p><strong>On to Pricing.</strong></p>, <p>Fluxiom is smoking something if they think they can mass market their product with no free version and <a href=""http://www.fluxiom.com/pricing/"">minimum pricing</a> of 9 Euros (about $11.21) per month for just 200 MB of storage. And while they offer a 30 day free trial for all accounts, they require a credit card to open an account. If you don’t terminate before the end of the free trial, your card is automatically charged.</p>, <p>Pricing for online storage has effectively been benchmarked by <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/14/amazon-grid-storage-web-service-launches/"">Amazon’s S3</a> – $0.15/month/GB of storage and $0.20/GB transferred. At those much more reasonable prices, Fluxiom’s 200 MB product should cost $0.03 per month (plus a bit for bandwidth), not 9 Euros. <strong>To look at this another way, Fluxiom’s pricing is 373 times what Amazon would charge for the same storage.</strong> Yes, Fluxiom has built a nice interface on top of their storage service, but this pricing is flat out outrageous.</p>, <p>So, Fluxiom is a great product but the team needs to seriously reconsider pricing if they want to compete in the already crowded online storage market.

Download Your TV – The Current Options,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Downloadable television, first made popular by Tivo and its competitors, is compelling stuff. As consumers become accustomed to watching a show whenever they choose, pausing at will and fast tracking through commercials, tuning in to a station at a scheduled broadcast time seems quaint at best. Today, <a href=""http://blogs.zdnet.com/ITFacts/?p=10166"">7% of U.S. households</a> have a digital video recorder, or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder"">DVR</a> and most cable companies offer a DVR as an option.</p>, <p>File trading networks, such as bittorent, are also extremely popular (if sometimes illegal) choices for consumers wanting access to time-shifted television content.</p>, <p>While DVRs are great, content producers and distributors are <a href=""http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=187"">less than thrilled</a> by the loss in revenue from all those skipped commercials. Also, DVR’d shows cannot be easily transferred to mobile devices or otherwise viewed away from their home television. Some consumers want more flexibility and options.<br/>
<strong><br/>
Enter downloadable television, spearheaded by iTunes.</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>On October 12 2005, Apple introduced iTunes 6.0 which added support for purchasing and viewing of video content from the iTunes Music Store. iTunes initially offered a selection of several thousand music videos and five TV shows, including most notably ABC’s Lost and Desperate Housewives, as well as the collection from past seasons. New shows are available 24 hours after the initial broadcast. Since that time, the collection has expanded with NBC Universal, USA Network, Sci-Fi Channel shows, and Viacom, in addition to further Disney-owned networks’ shows. iTunes also gives the ability to view Apple’s large collection of movie trailers. Format for purchased Videos is 128 kbit/s Protected MPEG-4 video.</p>, <p>By <a href=""http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/jan/26itms.html"">January 2006</a>, iTunes offered over 40 television shows for download, including, most recently, additions from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and MTV with episodes of such shows as the Daily Show, Spongebob Squarepants, South Park, and Punk’d. Showtime added some content in <a href=""http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/feb/07showtime.html"">February</a>.</p>, <p>The networks, though, are hoping that iTunes will not be the only way people watch TV on their computers. CBS, Fox and ABC are all experimenting with their own direct downloads or streaming.</p>, <p><strong>ABC</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>ABC is offering <a href=""http://dynamic.abc.go.com/streaming/landing"">streaming versions of a number of its hit shows</a> to viewers within the U.S. for no charge: Lost, Desperate Housewives, Alias, and Commander in Chief. The shows are viewable in 400×700 Flash format. On the plus side, ABC’s offering is browser and platform agnostic, and are free. On the minus side, and these are big ones, you must be online to view the show. You can’t take these with you on a laptop or other device and watch them while on a plane, or otherwise offline. Also, There are a number of short commercials that cannot be skipped. So in the end, ABC is offering a nice way for me to watch time-shifted shows on my PC-enabled living room television, but not much else. See <a href=""http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2006/05/abc-full-episode-streaming"">Mike Davidson</a> for more on this.<br/>

Shows cost $.99 and must be watched within 24 hours of downloading (again, not a very good option for travelers). You must have a Windows PC to view the shows. They cannot be burned to dvd. Frankly, with all of these limitations I’m surprised they even let you watch the show, period. It’s like they’re begging to fail so that they can say “hey, see, we tried, people don’t want this.” Note that CBS is also <a href=""http://video.google.com/cbs.html"">experimenting</a> with shows on Google Video.</p>, <p><strong>NBC</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>NBC is offering a number of shows through iTunes, but has no direct to consumer offering. They offer thirteen shows on iTunes, including The Tonight Show, Late Night with Conan O’Brien, Saturday Night Live, The Apprentice, Law and Order, Scrubs and The Office, as well as a number of vintage shows.</p>, <p><strong>FOX</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>Fox is shaking things up a bit. In April they <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/04/14/tv-moves-aggressively-to-the-internet/"">announced</a> a six year deal with their affiliates to allow them to show back catalog shows on the internet.  They are also starting to roll out <a href=""http://www.paidcontent.org/myspace-to-offer-24-downloads"">downloads</a> of the show “24” through their Myspace property, but I am unable to find much information on it yet.</p>, <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>, <p>It’s going to be a while before the service models are compelling enough for the world to turn away en masse from today’s TV, but it’s clear we’re at the start of a major disruption that will shake content producers (the networks) and the distributors (cable) to the core.</p>, <p>Nothing is close to challenging iTunes yet for downloadable tv dominance (well, except bittorent and DVRs), and it’s unlikely a single network will be able to do much to overcome them. People want to be able to consume their content in one place, and iTunes does a very good job of allowing that. It’s simple, has some flexibility with regard to moving to a device and the shows do not “expire”. The real competition to iTunes is still to come:  Yahoo, Microsoft, Google and Amazon, among others, will have product offering in this space sooner or later. (Note: AOL is already <a href=""http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/AOL_to_launch_online_TV_service"">streaming</a> a number of vintage television shows to users).</p>, <p>Business models need to change. Content producers cannot rely on network deals, 30 second advertising and, later, dvd sales, to pull in the revenue. Shows will have to stand on their own, and will probably need to be free for the first few episodes to pull in viewers who may eventually be willing to pay. Frankly, <strong>I look forward to the day that a show, ignored by the networks, first decides to launch itself on iTunes and go straight to consumers.</strong> The press around it would be overwhelming. The first to do it will have a big advantage.</p>, <p>There is a market for third party service providers, too. Services like <a href=""http://www.meevee.com/"">Meevee</a> are starting to bridge the gap between providing online television listing information and allowing people to actually view the content on their computers. <a href=""http://cozmo.tv/?&amp;versionChecked=true"">Cozmo.tv</a> and <a href=""http://blog.brightcove.com/blog/2006/05/hello_tivo.html"">Brightcove</a> are allowing people to control their Tivo’s through their browser. And how long will it be before <a href=""http://mobitv.com/"">MobiTV</a>, which currently streams television to mobile devices, is able contractually to simply flip a switch and offer streaming television direct to a PC? They are already <a href=""http://mobitv.com/press/press.php?i=press/release_051006_02"">making moves</a> in that direction, and <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/23/orb-stream-pc-media-to-mobile-device/"">Orb offers a similar, free service</a>.<br/>

They’ll immediately let in the first few hundred requests and then trickle in new users after that (if you don’t see a box to request a beta account, they haven’t switched over to the new site yet). Once you are a member, you can invite others to use the service.</p>, <p>Renkoo, like competitor <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/09/skobee-just-launched-so-start-using-it/"">Skobee</a>, helps people plan events (the pre-evite stage).

That means the event page updates in real time as your friends give their input. The experience is similar to instant messaging. Users who aren’t logged in see the comment stream once they are.</p>, <p>Renkoo also allows instant messenger, email and sms notifications of events, comments, etc. (all user controlled).

Teach your children,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">Normally I wouldn’t write about this. I’d keep my head down, hoping that someone else would say what I might. Many of the people cited in Rafe Needleman’s post are friends, professional colleagues, and actors in the Web 2.0 comedy. But this stuff isn’t funny, trading in the politics of personal destruction is not professional, and letting this slide is not an act of friendship.</p>, <p>Writing or producing or performing for a living opens us up to the slings and arrows of those who feel helpless, unrepresented, or disrespected. The way the Internet works, anonymity is a shield to hide behind. The only thing worse than that anonymity is the fix for it: digital numbers tatooed on every arm. As we found out in the last administration, destroying our human rights to torture the potentially innocent backfires when we all are presumed guilty.</p>, <p>If anonymity is worth the cost, we have to find some other ways to keep the discourse at what my father used to call a low howl. As a father of two children (15 and 8) my responsibility is to leave them with a sense of what is the right thing to do. My father has been dead for 34 years, but I can conjure up at any moment what he might think about any action I’ve ever taken. Of course, I’m really just mapping my sense of what’s right on top of what he taught me to honor.</p>, <p>The actions of the haters in the virtual world may be excused as a function of the distancing of technology, but I think that’s just blaming the tools — guns don’t kill, bullets do. We all know better than to revel in the tyranny of the whisper, the flexing of the innuendo, the bullying of the vulnerable. But as parents, we fail when we let the hatred pass as just another day’s work, a kind of wink and a nod that excuses the drumbeat of thoughtless banter and real fear slipped in along with the childish and class cut-upping.</p>, <p>Do we really have to let this get as far as death threats before we realize how seriously off the rails we are? It shouldn’t be this way, but it is. And since it is, it’s time for a trip to the principal’s office, not for the kids but for us parents. The kids don’t know better, but we do and yet we condone this crap as entertainment, or competition, or all’s fair in love and war.</p>, <p>I’ll continue to joust with the haters and the ignorant, the ones who sign their names especially. But someone from the world I inhabit (and I dismiss the argument that the mainstream and new medias are fundamentally different) who treats hate as a parlor game will need to fix this before I will continue to respect and compete with him or her. Because entertaining with hate is teaching the young that this is OK, that they have something to aspire to, something to achieve, something to profit from.</p>, <p>We all make mistakes. I’ve made plenty, and I’m sure I’ll hear more about them after this. Three of the people in Rafe’s article are members of the Gillmor Gang, and Dave Winer is one of the main reasons we all have the power in our fingertips to speak our minds in this digital age of lowered barriers. These people don’t deserve these attacks, period. Neither do their families and friends. I take it personally. So should you.</p>]"

Did YouTube Just Raise another $25 million?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.youtube.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>I’ve heard from three independent sources that <a href=""http://www.youtube.com"">YouTube</a> may have very quietly raised another $25 million in venture capital after raising <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/t/pr_051107_funding"">two</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/t/pr_060405_funding"">rounds</a> totalling $11.5 million from Sequoia Capital. YouTube’s last round ($8 million) was <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/t/pr_060405_funding"">announced</a> just a month ago, on April 5, 2006.</p>, <p>There are two reasons why I think this rumor may be accurate. First of all, YouTube is on a roll: 35 million videos are watched daily and they have 13 million unique monthly visitors. Bandwidth costs for all of these videos adds up: Forbes reports that YouTube’s bandwidth fees are approaching <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/home/intelligentinfrastructure/2006/04/27/video-youtube-myspace_cx_df_0428video.html"">$1 million per month</a>. Since YouTube is revenue-free (they just started placing ads on the site in March), they need more than $11.5 million in capital to keep up with growth.</p>, <p>Second, it is also understandable that they would raise a lot of cash over two rounds given that Sequoia Capital is involved and almost certainly has veto rights over new rounds of financing. Sequoia will want to maintain their equity share of the company (probably in the 25-30% range), but won’t want to pay current prices for those shares by participating in a new market valued venture round. The solution? Do a round at a lower valuation where only Sequoia participates, and then follow up with a subsequent round (possibly only days later) with new venture capitalists at a significantly higher valuation. This is the VC game, and funds like Sequoia can pull this off with their hotter startups.</p>, <p>Like I said, this is only a rumor (and I’ve been <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/01/18/youtube-is-probably-being-acquired/"">dead wrong</a> with YouTube rumors in the past), but this one makes a lot of sense.</p>]"

This network is being designed to deliver mobile broadband services across the nation, including urban, suburban and rural areas, and Sprint Nextel and Clearwire expect to build their own respective portions and enable roaming between the respective territories.</p>, <p>“This arrangement will result in stronger competition in the rapidly growing market for broadband services, and will provide consumers, national enterprises and other businesses, educators and public safety agencies greater choice and faster access to a revolutionary mobile broadband technology,” said Sprint Nextel Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gary Forsee. “It will further our objective of delivering mobile WiMAX service across the country and help fulfill our vision of delivering mobility products and services across all our networks.”</p>, <p>This agreement isn’t a done deal; so don’t go out looking for WiMax laptop cards or a WiMax handset. The deal is subject to the execution of definitive agreements, but these expected to be finalized within the next 60 days.

Plaxo, now with 11 million or so members and adding 20,000 per day, is in an excellent position to leverage its address book features into new product lines. Calendaring is an obvious next step.</p>, <p>The size of the aquisition was not announced but is almost certainly single digit millions. Here’s the full text of the press release:</p>, <p><span id=""more-1398""></span></p>, <p><strong>PLAXO TO ACQUIRE WEB 2.0 CALENDAR START-UP HIPCAL</strong></p>, <p><em>New York Fraternity Brothers Create Upstate UpStart<br/>
and Land Silicon Valley Jobs</em></p>, <p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.—May 1, 2006— Plaxo®, Inc., creator of the smart address book, has agreed to acquire innovative start-up HipCal, developer of an award-winning online calendar service. The acquisition will strengthen Plaxo’s calendar platform, and extend the company’s business model with new revenue-generating offerings.</p>, <p>The HipCal announcement highlights Plaxo’s commitment to providing its members with the best tools and services for accessing and managing all of their personal information on any platform, email client, browser, or mobile device. The addition of HipCal’s team and technology will dramatically accelerate Plaxo’s efforts in the calendar space, bringing lifestyle management tools such as appointment management, iCal publication and subscription, and group calendars to Plaxo members by the end of 2006.</p>, <p>Fraternity Brothers Head to The Valley<br/>
Five fraternity brothers originated HipCal while attending Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), located in Troy, New York. The team quickly realized their online calendar and to-do list was more than a success among friends — lots of people were using it. They decided to turn school project into a business and HipCal immediately took off — inside and outside of RPI. In less than six months, the beta grew to thousands of subscribers and garnered awards from both South by Southwest (SXSW) and SEOmoz.org’s Web 2.0 Awards.</p>, <p>“Our goal with HipCal was simply to create a calendar that makes sense,” said Garret Heaton, co-founder and lead programmer, HipCal. “While we created a fantastic online calendar, as a standalone service, we realized more could be done to achieve its fullest potential. Together with Plaxo, we can give people one central, easily accessible service for all the information they need to organize their personal and professional lives.”</p>, <p>“In the less than four years, Plaxo has fundamentally changed the way people think about the address book,” said Ben Golub, president and CEO, Plaxo, Inc. “With the addition of the skilled HipCal team, we plan to do for the calendar what we did for the address book. The combined Plaxo/HipCal vision will result in the most complete and convenient solution for accessing and updating all of your personal information, and for helping you to stay organized and in-touch with friends, colleagues, customers, and family.”</p>, <p>Today, Plaxo offers a smart, self-updating address book that is accessible from any web-enabled device. Plaxo also provides members with universal access to their calendar, tasks and notes. An enhanced, fully integrated and always-accessible calendar raises the bar on what an address book should do giving Plaxo a distinct competitive advantage because it is the natural tie-in with the address book.</p>, <p>Plaxo will acquire all assets of HipCal, including the technologies, for an undisclosed amount. The five founders will become Plaxo employees, but will continue to maintain the HipCal service until its functionality can be incorporated into Plaxo. Plaxo intends to incorporate all of the existing HipCal functionality into its free service. In addition, Plaxo will develop premium, calendar-related services.</p>, <p>About Plaxo<br/>
Plaxo, Inc., (www.plaxo.com) is used by over 10 million people in over 83 countries, and enjoys a wide following in academia, government, and both small and large businesses, including 98 of the Fortune 100 companies. Plaxo makes it easy for members to connect to their personal information, friends and colleagues in the manner that is most appropriate. The company has created a network of people whose contact information is always up-to-date through seamless address book updating that occurs between linked members. Plaxo Premium Services expand the functionality of Plaxo and include Plaxo Address Book Optimizer, Plaxo eCards, Plaxo Mobile Access, and Plaxo VIP Support.</p>, <p>Founded in 2001, Plaxo is a privately held company funded by leading investment and technology firms – Sequoia Capital, Globespan Capital Platforms, Harbinger Venture Management and Cisco Systems – as well as individual investors Ram Shriram and Tim Koogle.</p>, <p>About HipCal<br/>

Spotback is a personalized news portal that learns from user behavior over time to deliver the news that’s just right for them.</p>, <p>Web 2.0 news sites usually fall into one of two categories. Sites like <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/18/the-power-of-digg/"">Digg</a> and <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/tag/Newsvine/"">Newsvine</a> take user feedback and actions to affect what the entire community sees. Personalized sites like <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/tag/findory/"">Findory</a> change what they present to a single user based on his or her actions over time. Spotback falls into the latter category – a personalized news site that changes for each user over time based on what they like and don’t like (although they also have a Top Stories tab with the most highly rated news from all users).</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=138759380&amp;size=o""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>Each news item on Spotback can be rated by a user, saved, and/or emailed to others (click on image to right for larger view). Users may comment on any story. The source of the news item can also be marked, to tell Spotback to include more news like this, or to block items like it (or from that source). Finally, users can also customize the page to include whatever news categories they like (business, sports, etc.) or an RSS reader widget, which allows a user to add any news source that may not already be included in the Spotback index.</p>, <p>Here’s what I like best about Spotback – there is no requirement to set up a user account, you can simply access the site (personalized via cookie) if you choose to.

Is the big convergence for Mobile 2.0 going to be with gaming and advertising? That’s a possibility say some experts, as the number of mobile users double to four billion over the next five years. For mobile marketing campaigns to be effect these need to be unobtrusive and relevant. So how do you do it? By making the marketing campaign part of a game.</p>, <p>Sprint recently conducted a survey of US Consumer Wireless Usage, and found that one-third of respondents said that they want to play games on their handsets. And a report by Global Industry Analysts further predicts that the global mobile gaming market will cross $20 billion by 2010. With mobile video still in a state of flux, it certainly sounds like mobile gaming could be the platform that marketers will likely adopt in the not too distant future.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.adotas.com/2007/07/mobile-ad-market-giving-gaming-the-eye""><br/>

New Blog Search Engine Sphere Launches,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.sphere.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>New blog search engine <a href=""http://www.sphere.com"">Sphere</a> launched just moments ago and has also announced a <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2006/05/01/sphere-launches-with-new-cash/"">$3.75 million round of venture financing</a>. In addition to covering the launch of Sphere here, we have a <a href=""http://www.talkcrunch.com/?p=12"">podcast interview with CEO Tony Conrad and advisor Toni Schneider over at TalkCrunch</a>.</p>, <p>Sphere, which follows in the footsteps of previous blog search engines like Feedster, Technorati and IceRocket, as well as offerings from Google and Yahoo, is doing things quite a bit differently than its predecessors (and its evolved dramatically since our <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/14/first-screen-shot-of-sphere/"">first look at it</a> back in October).</p>, <p>Sphere’s design, by the way, was created by Adaptive Path. See their essay on the project <a href=""http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000614.php"">here</a>.</p>, <p>The site is segmented into three main areas: blog search results, featured blogs, and related media.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/sphere1.gif""/></p>, <p>Sphere <a href=""http://www.sphere.com/search?q=web+2.0&amp;sortby=rel&amp;lang=en&amp;datedrop=7"">search results</a> can be viewed by date, relevance or a combination of both. Unlike Technorati, which determines a blog’s relevance based on the total number of unique links into that blog, Sphere is taking an algorithmic approach. For Sphere, “relevance” is based on three key factors: links in/out of blog; meta data around the blog (average length of posts, post frequency, etc; and a semantic analysis of the posts themselves). In our tests Sphere blog relevance is very good. We’ll do a more in depth review and comparison at a later date.</p>, <p>Another feature is a “custom date search”. In addition to preset date selections, if you do a custom date search by selecting it in the drop down box, you’ll get results just for that date range and you’ll also see a day by day breakdown showing results per day with the included term.</p>, <p>Each search result has a link to a blog profile that includes basic blog information (links in and out, average post frequency and length and additional information). In the future an extended profile for each blog will be available that will include information from the blogger as well, such as a photo, a zip code for geotagging, and topics the blog covers.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>The most relevant blogs for thousands of search terms are listed in the “<a href=""http://www.sphere.com/featured-blogs?q=web+2.0&amp;sortby=rel&amp;lang=en&amp;datedrop=7"">featured results</a>” area.</p>, <p>If you don’t see search results for what you are looking for, click over the the most highly rated blogs for your search term to research further. These results are based on the same algorithmic analysis as blog search.</p>, <p>Want to go beyond blogs for your research? Click on “<a href=""http://www.sphere.com/related-media?q=web+2.0&amp;sortby=rel&amp;lang=en&amp;datedrop=7"">related media</a>” and see related pictures, news, books and podcasts relevant to your query.</p>, <p>As great as the basic search platform is, what I like best about Sphere is in the <a href=""http://www.sphere.com/tools"">Tools</a> area. Install the “Sphere It” bookmarklet and click it whenever you are reading something that you’d like more information on.

Life is Good Indeed,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""lgmobile.jpg"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/lgmobile.jpg""/>LG Electronics likes to say that “Life’s Good” and for their mobile phone unit, this couldn’t be more true. LG Electronics earned its largest-ever quarterly operating profit in the mobile phone sector, while rival Samsung Electronics actually suffered a decrease in sales.</p>, <p>LG’s growth is attributed to an increase in sales of its GSM handsets in Europe as well as Central and South America, along with WCDMA phones in Korea, Asia and North America.<br/>

Because Bluetooth Is So 2005,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""right"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/nokia20logo.gif""/></p>, <p>Nokia today announced that they’re working on a new short-range wireless system that they hope will replace Bluetooth. Wibree, as they call it, will be utilized for smaller accessories than just cell phones. It could be incorporated into watches and remote control toys because of its smaller size transmitter and low amount of power usage.</p>, <p>The technology was developed by the Nokia Research Center and changes the power output based upon the size of the data packet being sent–which is pretty cool. Because of this, it’s better suited as a sensor than a way to transmit movies from one device to another. Soon, Nokia will start working with Broadcom, Epson, and Nordic Semiconductor to create the chips and Suunto and Taiyo Yuden will begin working on the software side. No roll-out date, but the final specs are expected during second quarter of 2007 and maybe we’ll start seeing it installed soon after.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.mobile-tech-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=46700"">Nokia Working on Bluetooth Alternative</a> [Mobile Tech Today]</p>]"

Nike+iPod Hands On,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""left"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/bug2.jpg""/>I know this is a bit late in the game for this device, but I got a chance to strap these things on recently and wanted to report on the general value of the Nike+iPod line. First off, this kit has one fatal flaw – they really only work with the Nike+ shoes which come in only one or two models. A buddy of mine cut a hole in his old shoes and stuffed the transmitter in there, shown here seated in the shoe, so if you want to try the device without the Nike+ shoe, make sure the insole is soft enough to cut with an X-Acto knife.</p>, <p><span id=""more-1412""></span></p>, <p>That said, I consider the iPod attachment and software to be an indispensable addition to my workout routine. I’ve used pedometers before and have never really been amazed. However, this kit just “works.” You plug in the dongle, slap the transmitter in your shoe, and start running. The iPod syncs with iTunes and Nike’s own website and then you simply rinse and repeat. I carry my Nano with me when I run anyway, so why not add on a little hunk of plastic to tell me how far I’ve run.</p>, <p><img class=""center"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/nikeipodshoes.jpg""/></p>, <p>The Nike+ website is actually quite useful. It shows each run using a fancy flash graphical interface and offers a minimum of confusing options — goal setting, history, and “virtual races” with your buddies is about it. Best of all? Old Lance Armstrong congratulates you when you reach a personal record. Well, his pre-recorded voice does.</p>, <p>The shoes themselves, at least the model I received, are typical of Nike running shoes. I have quite a few issues with pronation, so I would have preferred to pair this with some more stable shores, but they’ve been fairly sturdy so far. As I said before, you can pair these with other shoes, but you have to be good with arts and crafts.</p>, <p>In all, if you’re looking for a pedometer kit, look no further. At $29 for the adapter and a $150 for the shoes, you’re looking at an investement of about $180. If you figure out a way to attach it to your current shoes – I could see placing it in a little plastic bag and sticking it in the lacing – then you’ve got an even better deal. However, many popular pedometer watches and other devices cost about the same and are much harder to manage. If they added a heart-rate monitor to this thing, it would really be a winner.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.nike.com/nikeplus/"">Product Page</a></p>]"
CityCita is jumping into the social organization jungle,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://citycita.com""><img alt="""" class=""shot2"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/citycittalogo.jpg"" style=""float:right;""/>After </a><a href=""http://www.meetup.com"">Meetup</a> and recently reviewed <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/04/28/renkoo-beeta-launches/"">Renkoo</a>, France based <a href=""http://www.citycita.org/"">CityCita</a> is bringing up together a new service that help groups create group events in a smart way with a nice series of features. CEO Jamin Rubio mentionned they are about to launch the service in private beta next Monday and the services will be aimed at the US market first although anyone will be able to register the service.</p>, <p>The interesting approach of CityCita is that is <strong>it truely group/topic based and geo-localized</strong>. You first need to register to start or join a new group which will eventually be accessible through a permanent URL (for example http://techcrunch.citycita.com). In order to do that you need to create a group, meaning any defining of choosing a tag (coca cola, jazz, web2.0, elvisfans,…) as well as a localization (a country and a city that are pre-defined). You can either leave that group for people to join or have limited access on based on an access code. As a visitor you can easily join a group by picking up first your interest through a tag cloud or a search and also find the closest group to your place of living. And if it does not exist then you are free to create one.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/home.png""/></p>, <p>Once your group is set up you can start doing all kind of things with CityCita starting by <strong>creating events</strong>. They integrated APIs of Google and Yahoo maps for you to be able to define precisely the venue of that event and share it with the rest of the group. You will be able also to feed your group with all kinds of elements like pictures (API of flickr is integrated) todo list, hosted shared items (any digital documents). <strong>You can virtually manage of all aspects of a given group </strong>and the list of features if quite complete (change layout, group name, nominate assistants, de-activate members, step down as organizer and nominate volunteers). An interesting feature is the “Spread the word” where you can find all kinds of tools to create buzz on your group on and offline for example with easy-to-build flyers. For a better view and screenshots click <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/ouriel/tags/citycita/"">here</a></p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/group_homepage_logged.png""/></p>, <p>The main difference with meetup is that it is <strong>really topic oriented</strong> meaning that you can really define your interest and not choose among a directory of pre-defined center of interests leaving room for any kind of specific group and passions. Unlike Renkoo the set of features around group management is much wider although the actual event organizing features seems to be more sophisticated in Renkoo. In a word CityCita is a fusion of Meetup/Renkoo with Yahoo Groups.</p>, <p>Like <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/help/organize/#org_cost"">Meetup</a>, CityCita is free and ad-supported if you wish to create one group and will become premium (from 9 to 25$/months) for organizers if you wish to create more than one group. In premium accounts you will get a series of extra features like billing mechanism (think party fees, conferences,..), hosting,…</p>, <p>Globally CityCita is well designed and well thought, it will be helpful to anyone wishing to manage a group of users and create event related to it even if it takes a little while to digest all the options to get into it.</p>, <p>CicyCita just closed a first seed round with seasoned internet professionals (one of them is heading one of the hottest radio station in France) and they put together a team of talented professionals. However <strong>reaching critical size </strong>will be their challenge and they will have to find the right marketing channels to make it big. Social management/organization is clearly a hot topic where startup and the big guys (Yahoo are half way with Yahoo Groups there and MySpace could easily plug an add-on) are getting into. Meetup is leading the way with (only) 2 million members and there is still a long way to go. So let’s follow up to see how this is all progressing.</p>, <p>If you wish to beta-test CityCita you can leave you email address <a href=""http://www.citycita.org/welcome/"">here</a>.

MMOs consume players into the depths of their mom’s basement, where they will never see the light of day again. In other words, these games are literally massive, taking players up to hundreds of hours to fully explore what the game has to offer. Produced by the editorial staff of Computer Games Magazine, Massive is a new magazine that focuses entirely on MMOs. This may seem like a dull idea at first, but if you’ve ever played a MMO, you’ll quickly realize that there are just tons of events and information that revolve in a game’s world.

As co-founder and CEO John Roberts delivered the opening keynote at the SugurCon 2009 developer conference in San Francisco, he showed the growth in a series of cascading dots spreading across the US, Europe, and Asia.</p>, <p>With the economic meltdown in full swing, Roberts sees an opportunity for what he calls the Open Cloud, where a combination of unique value services and squeezing cost out will ride the cloud computing wave.

The Wii racing wheel, which doesn’t have an official title yet, is more of a tray for your Wii remote. Like the video states, there isn’t any circuitry or new technology in the actual wheel. All you have to do is place your Wii remote in the crevice on the wheel and you are ready to race. Another cool fact was that when you buy <i>Monster 4×4 World Circuit</i>, you won’t have to buy the Wii wheel separately.</p>, <p>One of the problems I see with the wheel is that it’s not attached to anything. There are lots of racing game fans out there (including me), that like the feel of an arcade racing wheel that is attached to a solid mount of some kind. Another problem is the strain it could cause on your arms, which was something we had actually mentioned <a href=""http://crunchgear.com/2006/09/11/ubisoft-wii-eel-to-ship-with-gt-pro-series/"">before</a>, during the first sightings of the wheel. If you’re actually holding the wheel up like an actual racing wheel (and not a buss driver), you’re going to start straining your hands a lot quicker than you would with a mounted wheel. There’s no release date on the wheel, but I’m excited to see all the different ways Nintendo will integrate it into the Wii.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.play-nintendo.com/news/06100305.html"">Wii Racing Wheel</a> [play nintendo]</p>]"

Ultimate Ears triple.fi 10 Pro Triple-Driver Earphones,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/><br/>
Ultimate Ears has spent most of the past 11 years creating custom-molded headphones for musicians. But not to be outdone by the likes of Shure and Etymotic, UE put out a line of more consumer-friendly universal-fit earbuds last year under the super.fi name. Today, it announced the pre-order availability of its $399 triple.fi 10 Pro headphones that feature three miniature speakers per earpiece. Two of the three speakers are bass drivers allowing low-freqs to be more balanced for greater definition and clarity. The third speaker handles high-freqs, with all three accurately blending before the sound hits your eardrum. </p>, <p>
I tested out the original super.fi’s and I’m in the process of testing the triple.fi’s (a full review posting in the near future), but so far the sound these ‘buds produce is nothing short of beatific. Plus, they’re sweet-looking, extremely comfortable and seal out nearly all extraneous sound. Anyone considering laying out a few hundred dollars for quality headphones would be well served by the triple.fi 10 Pros. </p>, <p>

Microsoft Quietly Launches Froogle Competitor,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://products.live.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>Microsoft Live Products launched today at <a href=""http://products.live.com"">products.live.com</a>. They’ve included retail products from 100,000 sellers. Like Froogle, Live Products is a commerce-only search engine/shopping comparison engine that will, hopefully, give users more relevant results when looking to buy items online. Like Froogle, Live Products does not take payment from merchants for appearing within search results.</p>, <p>There is an important difference between Froogle and Live Products, however. Froogle takes data from merchants via a push model (merchants use a Froogle API to include information), whereas Live Products pulls the data from the main Live Search web index –  so Live Producst is presenting crawled results and algorithmic ranking. Merchants will be included if they are in the index without taking any additional steps.</p>, <p>Live Products is not as good as Froogle yet, although a big part of this may be due to the fact that Froogle, with their push model, obtain very structured data from merchants. Live Products, in contrast, structures the data directly.</p>, <p>Compare a search for “iPod” on <a href=""http://www.live.com/#q=%20%20%20ipod&amp;scope=products&amp;offset=1"">Live Products</a> v. the same search on <a href=""http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=ipod&amp;btnG=Search+Froogle"">Froogle</a> (screen shots of both are below). Froogle returns results near-instantly, whereas Live Products takes 2-4 seconds to return results on my computer. Froogle also returns just iPod results, whereas Live Products is including accessories, and even putting them above actual iPods in the results. Finally, while both services allow users to refine results by brand, seller or related terms, I like that Google includes this at the top of results without an additional click: its easier to notice (compared to Live Product’s very clean, but easy to miss drop down links) and it saves a click.</p>, <p>Froogle also includes user reviews of merchants, something that is in the planning stages at Live Product but hasn’t been released yet.</p>, <p>Live Products does have a couple of great features, though. The fact that they are taking information directly from the search index means they’ll have more complete data than Froogle. Also, I like the Ajax slider that controls how much information is returned for each result (including images on/off). I also like the ability to sort results by price, it’s a better way to see results v. Froogle’s refinement by price feature.</p>, <p>Some users will like using Live Products for ecommerce related searches. It makes sense for Microsoft to address this group – the ads that are served on Live Products are going to be significantly more targeted, and therefore more expensive, than similar ads on general search.</p>, <p>No word yet on how Live Products will integrate, if at all, with Live Shopping. The good news is that, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/04/28/microsoft-blows-live-shopping-launch-no-firefox/"">unlike Live Shopping</a>, Live Products works with Firefox.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/liveproducts1.gif""/></p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/liveproducts2.gif""/></p>]"

Burger King has announced it will be releasing three Xbox and Xbox 360 games that will be available  for $3.99, with the purchase of a value meal. The three titles, rated E, are <i>Pocketbike Racer</i>, <i> Big Bumpin’</i>, and <i>Sneak King</i>. Two of the three games will feature online play via Xbox Live. Just what parents need: their kids eating unhealthy food and then wanting to go home and sit in front of the TV with their new game. If the games offer Microsoft Achievement Points, don’t be surprised if they sell like crazy.</p>, <p>Joystiq purposed the question, “Why is Burger King offering actual games for $3.99, rather than the cheaper route of selling digital download codes that would allow users to download the games as Xbox Live Arcade games?” I think the answer is just better marketing strategy. The purpose of a fast-food joint is to come in, point at a number, quickly get food, eat it and leave. When a consumer is presented with a game available for purchase right in front of them, they will be much more inclined to pay $3.99 to get their hands on it right away. Burger King will be offering the games from November 19 to December 24, and please don’t get someone one of these for the holidays.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.joystiq.com/2006/10/02/the-king-is-in-your-xbox-360/"">The King is n Your XBox 360</a> [Joystiq]</p>]"

It is a self-described “commons for sharing outlines, feeds, and taxonomy.” It will gather a community of subscription lists and aggregate them in interesting and useful ways.</p>, <p>To participate, create an account and upload an OPML file containing the content feeds that you read. Most feed readers like Bloglines, NewsGator, Rojo, Attensa, etc. store the feeds that you read in the OPML file format and can be exported. The feeds that are included in your OPML file are aggregated with feeds other people have uploaded. If you don’t know what all this stuff means, don’t worry. You can still use the site to find new sources of content that you might like to read.</p>, <p>This aggregated data is useful. In particular, it will help people find new feeds that they may enjoy.</p>, <p>There’s a <a href=""http://share.opml.org/rankings/"">top 100 list </a>of the most popular feeds which could become the definitive top 100 list once there is a statistically relevant number of users (subject to SYO successfully controlling spam).

Dave Winer says that they’ll have per-feed sharing turned on within a few days.</p>, <p>Spam may become an issue with the site as people attempt to game the top 100 list. There are some controls in place now – a feed is only counted once even if it’s in an OPML file multiple times, and only once account can be created from a single email address. Dave has lots of experience dealing with spam from his days running the Weblogs.com ping server, so expect to see additional protective measures put in place as the service evolves.</p>, <p>If tools are added that make SYO the easiest place to manage your OPML (including adding feeds, removing feeds, batch operations, categorization/tagging, etc.), some of the more openminded RSS readers may start to allow customers to store their OPML at SYO instead of with the reader.

I like Feedburner because, frankly, I don’t want to spend a lot of time formatting templates and going through detailed reports: Feedburner’s one-size-fits-all approach is perfect for TechCrunch, and I like the fact that all of my RSS and email subscription statistics are managed in one dashboard. For bloggers looking for a more robust, customizable solution, or who want more detailed reporting, Zookoda is a very user friendly product that will work extremely well.</p>, <p>It’s important that bloggers offer an email option for readers – some people like to receive content this way.

While many people go out of their way to avoid advertising on TV, either by using DVRs to fast forward through the commercials, or by using that time to hit the bathroom and/or kitchen, many mobile TV viewers are actually willing to watch the ads on their phones. According to a new study by Telephia nearly half of the mobile video subscribers polled said that they were willing to view ads on their mobile handsets, at least if they could get some content of some value.</p>, <p>Mobile TV and video subscription revenues have grown nearly 200 percent year-over-year to $146 million in the first quarter of this year, and Telephia says that nearly 8.4 million wireless customers now subscribe to some form of mobile video. This represents nearly four percent of all U.S. mobile subscribers. And 55 of those polled for the survey said they recalled watching a mobile ad something in the last 30 days!

Microsoft Readies Vista for Piracy Wars,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/>Besides an advanced graphics engine, a new file browsing technology, and an updated interface, the next version of Windows may make some computers almost completely useless.</p>, <p>So let’s say you’re one of those nefarious types who likes to install Windows but doesn’t like to pay money for it. You’d be branded a pirate, Jolly Roger or not. In the early days, you had the run of the rum-filled seas, swapping serials numbers like shanties at the pourhouse. Then, the port authority (Microsoft) introduced its CheckIn system with Windows XP to put an end to your swashbuckling days. You were able to invent counterfeiting schemes that worked around all the documentation needed to drop anchor on your own hardware.</p>, <p>But with its largest payload in years (haha!) set to make port soon, MS has upped the security on its ship. For example, instead of just nagging you to register, Windows Vista will start limiting some services, such as web browsing and access to the files on the desktop. This goes far beyond the annoying “if you’re not legit, you don’t get Nilla wafers!” approach used previously, and goes straight to “we don’t care if you have our cargo, we’re putting you in Davy Jones’ locker!” It’s a move that’s going to put the average computer nerd squarely in their camp. That last sentence, lads, was sarcasm.</p>, <p>After so many years of fighting their users instead of courting them, Big Redmond is again using the stick instead of the carrot to meet its bottom line. Of course, Microsoft says this protection is to keep their stuff from being stolen in China and Russia where anti-piracy laws are token at best. That is a legitimate complaint, but rolling that crap out here is just really going to piss off some its customers who are at risk of the big switch. We mean people who want simple computing, not red tape. When people are tired of jumping through hoops just to use hardware they spent real money on, they start looking for alternatives, and at this point in the OS wars (oh, yeah, they’re back) that’s the very last thing they want or need.</p>, <p><a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061004/ap_on_hi_te/windows_vista_piracy"" target=""_blank""><br/>

Do More: Online To Do Lists Compared,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>Time is our most valuable commodity. Productivity pays. Procrastination costs us time and money, and leaves us stressed, exhausted and unreliable in the eyes of others.</p>, <p>For many, the classic “To Do” list is the remedy. But for heavy web users, there are a number of recently launched to-do list products to choose from, with convenient sharing and other features, and easy to use interfaces.</p>, <p>We’ve taken a look at five of the best.</p>, <p>Note: we steered clear of some of the more complex personal homepage and calendar products like <a href=""http://www.zohoplanner.com"">Zoho Planner</a> and <a href=""http://www.backpackit.com"">Backpack</a>  to try and compare only apples to apples.</p>, <p>We examined the usability and interesting features of these applications to find the most noteworthy procrastination remedy. All the products reviewed are free, and the normal set of features includes: sharing lists via email, emailing yourself a list and the ability to subscribe to your lists via RSS.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.blablalist.com"">Bla Bla List</a> is a simple to-do list product built on the RIFE, open-source Java web application framework. It’s fast, and offers the basic to-do list features and functionality. It tenders an easy-to-use interface, but loses points because of the annoyingly small pop-up window launched when you set up a new list.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.tadalist.com"">Ta-da List</a> by <a href=""http://www.37signals.com"">37signals</a>, the Chicago-based company, is built on Ruby on Rails and offers a wonderfully simple and clean to–do list product. Ta-da list uses lots of white space and larger fonts to make the list easy to read. 37signals subscribes to the rule of “<a href=""http://www.somewhatfrank.com/2006/04/37signals_found.html"">less is more</a>” and it shows.</p>, <p><a href=""http://tudu.ess.ch"">Tudu List</a> is unlike the rest of the to-do list products reviewed since it is not primarily a consumer-facing online solution. Instead Tudu list is an open-source solution which has been offered online by <a href=""http://app.ess.ch"">ESS Development AG</a>. Tudu list is intended to be downloaded and installed on your own host and is the outlier of the group but we felt it was appropriate to review since there is a free version running online. Tudu list provides the ability to create multiple to-do lists with prioritized items on a deadline. Some interesting features are the backup and restore features which allow downloading XML files of a list as a back. Lists can then be restored online via uploading an XML file. In addition, Tudu lists can be shared with others.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.rememberthemilk.com"">Remember The Milk</a>, an Australia-based company which was <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/13/rememberthemilk-to-do-lists"">previously reviewed on TechCrunch</a>, offers a smooth Ajax interface and rich user experience. It allows lots of metadata to be associated in the form of date information, repeat event and tags. Tasks can also be organized and prioritized by tab as well as sent to other Remember The Milk contacts. Tasks can be added via email, which could be a helpful feature especially if you have an email-enabled mobile device for on-the-go to-do updates.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.voo2do.com"">Voo2do</a>, created by software developer <a href=""http://rura.org/shimon"">Shimon Rura</a>, has a catchy name and a good (also Ajax) interface. However, it is a more complex project management task list than a simple to-do list. Voo2do tracks lists as tasks with assigned priority, due date and time estimates for each task. The interface is intimidating in comparison to Ta-da or Bla Bla list. Nevertheless, voo2do offers several interesting features including the ability to add a task via email, collaborate on password-protected shared to-do lists in addition to the ability to view your task history. Voo2do also has an API in progress which will allow developers to create custom applications.</p>, <p><strong>The easy-to-use Ta-da list, with its clean and simple interface and good-enough feature set, is in our opinion the best choice if you are looking for an effective and easy to use solution.</strong> Online to-do applications are becoming competitive; products like Bla Bla list closely match the Ta-da list features, and voo2do and Remember The Milk offer more complex and powerful to-do list products. One feature that I think all of the competition should look into is mobile-accessible to-do lists because, unless you print your lists for on-the-go use, the traditional paper- written to-do list still could trump all of these products.</p>]"

Live Messenger has a cleaner interface than MSN Messenger 7.5, the current non-beta release. Other improvements include integration with MSN video in the bottom of the window, and expansion of the VOIP pre-paid calling feature called Windows Live Call (powered by Verizon) into eight new markets (Austria, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands). You can also make some changes to the Live Messenger template, such as color customization. In addition, they are rolling out offline messaging so, like Yahoo and Skype IM, you can send a message to someone offline and they will receive it when they log in.</p>, <p>The feature that I like best about Live Messenger, though is the file sharing via integration with the previously acquired Foldershare product. Drag any kind of file into a contact name in the Live Messenger, and a folder will be created on each of your desktops with a copy of the file. Any changes to the file will be replicated in both folders. I use Skype for file transfers often, and the Live Messenger integration is quite a bit simpler and easier to use.</p>, <p>No word from the Live team as to when they’ll be rolling out APIs for the product, or even integrating it into their own Live.com, as Gtalk is integrated into the Gmail site. But anyone can now try Live Messenger, and new features are, I’m sure, on the way.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/livemessenger.gif""/></p>]"

But the overall aim of Gears is not just to offer users offline capabilities; Google wants to allow these web applications much of the same functionality enjoyed by desktop apps. We wrote about t<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2008/10/04/googles-gears-not-just-for-offline-accessibility/"">he powerful capabilities of the Gears platform </a>and Google’s potential to create a super browser and pseudo desktop applications for enterprises that could rival and perhaps surpass desktop applications like Microsoft Windows and Office.</p>, <p>Now add this thought to the mix. The recent offline option for Calendars was made exclusively available to enterprise users of <a href=""http://www.google.com/apps/"">Google Apps</a>, with no immediate notice of when regular users of Calendars would be able to access the offline versions. Google’s business software package is a set of its online applications, like Gmail, Google calendar, Google Docs, etc., that are packaged and tailored for enterprise use. According to Google, close to one million business owners are currently using the free version of the Apps product.  Originally a wholly free service, <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2009/01/23/google-puts-the-squeeze-on-free-apps/"">Google has gradually introduced a paid “premier service” of Apps</a>, while simultaneously rolling back the number of users allowed for the free service. The premier service for businesses costs $50 per user per year.</p>, <p>So here are a few questions I want to throw out for consideration. Is Google’s move to introduce the offline version of Calendar to enterprise users only the beginning of shift in the way it will roll out features based on the Gears platform? Is this all part of Google’s master plan to not only put a dagger in the heart of Microsoft office products by creating a better, cheaper desktop application for businesses, but also a strategy to create revenue (besides the existing advertising support) from Apps?</p>]"

Kerry Parkins, director, key audiences product marketing, calls it “a very natural extension” for AIM”s existing social network. Instead of people joining a created community a la Classic AOL, they have their own with the buddy list they already use at the core.</p>, <p>Unlike walled-garden Classic AOL, AIM Pages is built on giving users ways to collect and connect to various parts of the web — and each other — from one base. For instance, users can add a flickr module. “Our approach is not to get you to leave flickr but to super-set your stuff from flickr,” explained Parkins. Other modules focus on AOL content, like the Top 11 list from AOL Music; options will be limited at first with more modules being introduced on a rolling basis.</p>, <p>Asked what makes AIM Pages stand out from the other social networking sites where users can create a page and form community, Parkins said it’s the publishing tool, which was designed to make the process more simple and the results more attractive. To improve discoverability, AOL settled on an easy personalized domain — www.aim.com/[screenname].</p>, <p><strong>Still in flux:</strong> making money with AIM Pages. Parkins admitted, “Advertisers themselves are trying to get a handle on how to monetize in this space. In general, it’s not a great advertising play.” They’re working with advertisers to expand presence beyond the standard “build a profile for the Tom Hanks character in The DaVinci Code” but are concerned about it will play. Parkins: “You can create community around (a) product … but it’s a different advertising model. We really want to let the community grow first and be very vibrant before we introduce a degree of commercialism.” AIM, unlike some social network competitors, claims “significant reach” across all demographics.</p>]"
"Digital Chocolate to Publish for N-Gage… Wait, the N-Gage is Still Around?","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""digitalchocolate1.jpg"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/digitalchocolate1.jpg""/>The surprise news isn’t that California based mobile game developer Digital Chocolate would publish titles for the N-Gage platform, but rather that the N-Gage was around. The hybrid gaming device, mobile phone launched what seems like ages ago, and never caught on quite as much as Nokia expected. But apparently the platform is doing well enough to entice Digital Chocolate, which will be publishing a variety of titles for the system this fall.</p>, <p>“Digital Chocolate has been a driving force in promoting social interaction within the context of mobile gaming,” said Gregg Sauter, Nokia’s director of third party publishing. “They are also an award winning publisher dedicated to bringing innovative games to the masses.  It is these qualities that make Digital Chocolate a perfect fit for our N-Gage offering, which allows publishers to innovate with respect to quality, ease of use and community interaction.”</p>, <p>And while the original N-Gage may have failed, the brand is living on as a made-for-mobile game service and is compatible with Nokia Nseries and other S60 3rd edition devices. The newest series from Digital Chocolate include DChoc Café,which is meant to feature casual card, boardd and puzzle games for multiple players. Think of this as social networking meets gamers. The only question is whether there are really enough N-Gage users for a social networking service to work?</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.digitalchocolate.com"">Digital Chocolate</a><br/>

Squidoo: Seth Godin's Purple Albatross?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.squidoo.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>Seth Godin is an exceptional marketing consultant. I’ve read all his books – my favorite is <a href=""http://www.sethgodin.com/purple/"">Purple Cow</a>. I routinely bring up his ideas when talking to companies about the best way to get media and early adopter attention: build an exceptional, attention-grabbing product (and if you haven’t, go back and start again). It seems obvious, but most startups don’t think that way. They build something first, then think about the best way to market whatever it is that they’ve built (often by hammering away at journalists and spending whatever capital they have on Google adsense, Overture, etc.).</p>, <p>So when Seth put his name behind a new startup last year, <a href=""http://www.squidoo.com"">Squidoo</a>, people noticed, and expected one hell of a Purple Cow. The Squidoo idea was simple and easy to explain: allow anyone to build a single page, called a lens, on a topic that he or she is passionate about. The person building the lens, the “lensmaster”, gets recognition as an expert in his or her area of expertise, and cash. Squidoo shares a percentage of profits with its authors.</p>, <p>Now here’s the problem. If Squidoo doesn’t work out as planned, and I don’t think it will, Seth loses more than his time and whatever capital he’s put into Squidoo. He also loses credibility as an expert in product marketing. To borrow the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rime_of_the_Ancient_Mariner"">metaphor</a>, Squidoo could become an albatross around Seth’s neck.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Squidoo is a mixture of evergreen (static) and refreshed content.</p>, <p>Wikipedia is an excellent example of a site with evergreen content. Sure, its updated and refined, but the idea is that content on Wikipedia is something that is fairly stable and can be linked to reliably, as I did above. Wikipedia has a tremendous amount of authority for just about any piece of content. With all of this authority and inbound links (traffic), a site like Wikipedia could be massively monetized.</p>, <p>Blogs, on the other hand, are the very essence of refreshed content. People go back to blogs every day to see what’s new. Good blogs generate stickiness and repeat customers, which is also a model that can be monetized.</p>, <p>An example of a service that combines evergreen and refreshed content successfully is Myspace, which has both static content about a person and blog-like aspects where people can add fresh content.</p>, <p>Myspace works, however, because it’s a social network, with pages linking to eachother (your friends) in a way that produces massive inter-site traffic and networks-within-the-network. You can surf around Myspace all day just by clicking on a friend chain. People are also passionate about Myspace because the central plot of a page is you – and most people are pretty passionate about themselves.</p>, <p>Squidoo shares little in common with any of the services above because no one person can really be authoritative on a given topic. Wikipedia is group-created, edited and refined content, which gives it the authority it needs to get people to link to it. It’s unlikely that a Squidoo lens on a given topic (when there are a potentially infinite number of other lenses on the same topic) will ever gain that kind of authority. It would be like a Wikipedia with multiple entries on every topic – one for everyone who cared to write one.</p>, <p>To be fair, I have the benefit of hindsight. When Squidoo launched last December I was as excited as anyone about its potential. And Squidoo is still young and may very well reverse its current stagnation. But from what I see now, I wouldn’t bet on Squidoo being what Seth would call a Purple Cow.</p>, <p>I was forwarded a copy of the May email that Squidoo sent out to Lensmasters. It’s quite obvious from the email, as well as the <a href=""http://www.alexaholic.com/squidoo.com"">Alexa trend</a> (flat), that Squidoo is not seeing viral growth:</p>, <p>From: xxxxx<br/>
Date: May 5, 2006 8:36 AM<br/>
Subject: Your First Squidoo Paycheck (the real one!)<br/>
To: xxxxx</p>, <p>Hi, XXXXX!</p>, <p>It’s time for your first Squidoo paycheck.</p>, <p>(NB: If you got a cryptic one-liner email from us about this yesterday, please disregard it. Our computers went a little batty!)</p>, <p>We’re just out of beta, and we’re betting no one is going to retire on their lens earnings. But already some of you have earned as much as $30 (dinner for two!). Others have earned about $1. And still others have pooled their money to send thousands of dollars to places like Room to Read, which helps build schools for children in developing countries.</p>, <p>Chances are that what you’re seeing now is just a drop in the bucket. If you’re more interested in spreading ideas and traffic than making money, just send your share to a charity, where every  bit counts. Or, check out SquidU’s tips for upping your earnings: http://www.squidu.com/Learning_Library/making-more-money.</p>, <p>Below you’ll find a statement of your money earned from March 1 to March 31, 2006. Probably not on par with the lottery, but at least you can enjoy a cup of coffee on us.</p>, <p>Thanks,</p>, <p>The SquidTeam: Seth, Corey, Megan, Heath and Gil</p>, <p>The best lenses are generating $30 or so a month for the lensmaster. A true expert on a topic could generate many, many times that number by creating a blog, along with some static content, and putting up simple Google adsense ads. So top content producers are not going to be heading to Squidoo for the money, ever (Squidoo’s model is set up in such a way that they could never make as much money from a lens as they could on their own). And besides, the blog format just works better for experts – fresh content generates lots of links, which equals traffic and search engine juice.</p>, <p>The only unanswered question is whether or not experts will go to Squidoo even without the financial incentive. Maybe, but Squidoo’s tools are not particularly advanced – self publishing is easy these days.</p>, <p>Squidoo may generate some content creation growth, but I don’t see it generating serious page view growth under their current model.</p>, <p>So, if Squidoo continues to go sideways…how long before Seth starts to distance himself from his albatross?</p>]"

Thus the current fascination with realtime micromessaging and Track.</p>, <p>The past few days there’s been a flurry of <a href=""http://gillmorgang.beta.techcrunch.com/2009/02/07/gillmor-gang-020709/"">discussion</a> falling under the heading of “Google threatened by realtime people search.” The thesis is that search (Google) is based on the past, while Twitter search (Track) is based on realtime, i.e. now. The problem with this GUT is that this is not a new insight, has been discussed openly for several years, and seems surprisingly resistant to being monetized for such an epochal sea change.</p>, <p>Facebook’s move toward opening its realtime update stream does little to disrupt Twitter’s control of its dominant stream via rate limiting and corporate indirection. The GUT suggests micromessages are owned by the individual vendor, and the so-called Open crowd helps popularize what is in reality a shell game. In fact, the vendor who first claims ownership of the stream will immediately forfeit it.</p>, <p>First, it is not the stream that holds the value of the system — it’s the intersection of the active stream (Track) with the individual’s view of the peer group most likely to help winnow the stream down to manageable size. Having access to all the most important information in the world is useless without some way of managing it in real time. Twitter’s value proposition is the Follow cloud managed and extended by Track.</p>, <p>Second, we’ve had systems capable of broadcasting status messages for some time now. Search collected these signals – documents, posts, email, IM – and provided a system to assign value and therefore pricing to the data. Web 2.0 in effect was the API to these floating information objects, with search the primary driver of who gets to where first.</p>, <p>Third, the more we understand the value of these micro-objects, the more interested we become in getting the best deal for distributing them and deriving compensation for the effort expended to create and manage them. Once we understand how valuable Tweets are, we start looking for a manager or an agent.</p>, <p>Of course, there are only a few Scobles or Arringtons out there who can command a decent price for their individual messages. For the rest of us, we have to find support from affinity groups. Affinities come in many flavors, but they neatly divide into two groups: those we know about – church or sport or music or book club – and those who know about us. These implicit affinities are subtle and overlapping and dynamic.</p>, <p>Querying affinities requires a valid contract between the users who make up the groups and those who want to reach them. Google has enormous flow of user data about interest and intent, but little assent at the affinity level. Facebook’s assent is weakly typed because it’s difficult to distinguish between levels of “friendship”. Twitter’s Follow architecture provides the best explicit modeling of affinities, if, and it’s the Big If, Track is available to help balance asymmetry between a small number of Follows and a larger number of Followers.</p>, <p>So far Twitter has succeeded in maintaining growth and the perception of value within its communities of users and developers. FriendFeed has done a good job of challenging Twitter’s blockade of Track and realtime APIs, which hurts third party developers more than it does users. Facebook may make inroads with developers adding the Facebook stream to aggregation tools, and Facebook Connect is already provisioned to handle the news stream.</p>, <p>But any overt move to claim users or their affinity clouds will trigger extremely negative effects. Microsoft’s Hailstorm was viable only as long as it wasn’t wedded to an identity system. Google’s attempts to harvest social graph data from email behavior and graft it onto Google Reader shared feeds violated the implicit social contracts of two separate services. Yahoo’s MyBlogLog harvested data as the result of contracts with Web sites owners and without the clear consent of the users themselves.</p>, <p>Today these services seem somewhat neutered. Hailstorm was in the end deployed as Google Apps and Gmail instead of by Microsoft. Google Reader dominates the RSS aggregation market but has not been integrated into the Apps. MyBlogLog is disappearing from sites as Twitter and FriendFeed communities expand. Third party clients are mining realtime streams to identify and target valuable groups based on their anonymous shared behavior.</p>, <p>But the GUT says Google has peaked. The GUT says Facebook will slowly but surely suck the business model out of Twitter just when they finally discover it. My gut says the GUT will only be ratified by users when they are able to calculate the implicit value of their gestures and then get a check for that amount. The list of those capable of cutting such a check is not very long. It may be the ultimate stimulus package.</p>]"

IBM will be unveiling a number of new cloud computing technologies at its CIO Leadership Exchange in Shanghai and its Pulse Conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday with networking giant and Cisco-rival <a href=""http://www.juniper.net/"">Juniper Networks</a> by its side. We <a href=""http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/08/06/emerging-markets-key-for-cisco-and-competitors/"">reported last summer</a> that Juniper is doing a good job of making inroads on Cisco’s turf, and this partnership with IBM is a sign of Juniper’s continued strength in the cloud computing sphere, an area where <a href=""http://blogs.cisco.com/tag/cloud+computing"">Cisco is also hoping to make its mark</a>.</p>, <p>IBM, through its Blue Cloud Initiative, is rolling out a number of new cloud computing solutions for enterprise users, including joint Juniper Networks and IBM or businesses to install hybrid  public-private cloud capabilities across IBM’s 13 “Cloud Labs” spread across the world. The companies have created technology that would allows enterprises to extend their private clouds to remote servers in a secure public cloud at the click of a button. Once the technology is installed in the Cloud Labs, businesses can easily switch clients workloads when resources become constrained.</p>, <p>With cloud computing possibly representing a $42 billion market by 2012, it comes of no surprise that IBM is making some pretty hefty investments in its Blue Cloud Initiative. And the software giant is also seeing some big-name enterprise clients sign onto its cloud computing offerings. Elizabeth Arden, Nexxara, The U.S. Golf Association and Indigo Bio Systems are all using IBM’s services to add cloud computing to their IT infrastructures. TOTVS, a ERP provider in Latin America, is expanding its existing IBM cloud computing system.</p>, <p>Erich Clementi, IBM’s general manager of enterprise initiatives, made this statement professing IBM’s love for cloud computing:</p>, <p>“Enterprise clients need economically compelling solutions that help run their business in smarter ways, while never taking their eyes off security, resiliency and compliance. Cloud computing leverages many of IBM’s core strengths-such as open standards, service management, scalable systems, and excellence in data center operations-and gives clients the opportunity to leverage cloud computing’s considerable cost advantages, while maintaining the highest levels of integrity, responsibility and control.”</p>, <p>IBM also unveiled several new capabilities and services that would help businesses incorporate and maintain cloud computing into their IT infrastructures. The company launched a strategic planning arm, a design implementation service, extra security services, and a service management center for cloud computing, using IBM’s Tivoli software, to help clients deploy and manage clouds.</p>]"

You play against another player at your level, and the winner takes all of the money from the other person. So each time you win, you double your money. Win 30 times in a row and win $10.7 million. A user can “cash out” at any time and have a check delivered to them with their current balance. If you lose, you start over at $0.01.</p>, <p>The service is advertising supported. You have to watch a short video ad (every time I played it was for yellowpages.com) and then answer a question correctly about the ad. Once you’ve done that, you can play the next round.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/> I tried playing a few games and it seemed legitimate. I can’t tell if I was playing against a computer or not, though. Moola always found a rival to play against me within seconds, and the games are very simple and could be easily played by a computer.

The CEO of Moola addressed this question on the Moola <a href=""http://www.moola.com/moopubs/content/about/blog.jsp"">blog</a>.</p>, <p>What’s more interesting is Moola’s business model: paying users to watch ads.

State of Mobile Solutions for Enterprise: MobileAware’s Brian Kinane Offers Insight,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""mobileaware1.jpg"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/mobileaware1.jpg""/>Even before there were mobile devices a portion of the workforce was mobile, meaning they traveled frequently and relied on a variety of tools to stay in touch with home base. And today’s mobile workforce is relying on mobile applications more than road warriors of just a few years ago. So what do the mobile applications of today (and tomorrow) mean for those who are mobilizing their enterprises? MobileCrunch talks with Brian Kinane, executive vice president and chief strategy officer at MobileAware.</p>, <p><span id=""more-1519""></span></p>, <p>Brian Kinane is a co-founder of MobileAware and has overall responsibility for MobileAware’s product management and strategic business development. This role includes tactical and strategic product direction, analyst relations and executive relationships with key MobileAware enterprise and communication infrastructure partners. Prior to MobileAware, Brian held senior commercial consulting, marketing, business development and product roles with a range of industry leaders including Ericsson, Telia and Telenor, focused on value-added mobile and convergent services and associated delivery platforms. [<a href=""http://www.mobileaware.com/management_team.jsp"">MobileAware.com</a>]</p>, <p><strong>Mobile Crunch:</strong> What do you think is currently the state of mobile solutions for enterprise? Does mobile 2.0 offer the technology to make mobile enterprise a reality?</p>, <p><strong>Brian Kinane:</strong> Mobile solutions have traditionally focused on providing closed proprietary mobile applications that encoded business processes for the mobile worker. We are now seeing the transition from this approach to open strategic mobile platforms that enable business analysts to rapidly compose mobile business processes for both customers and employees. Increasingly, mobile is moving from specialized use-cases towards enabling more effective collaboration within and outside of the enterprise. As part of this shift, mobile enterprise technologies are increasingly converging with Web 2.0 and SOA concepts and technologies. This is enabling consumers and business analysts to compose value-added mobile applications from online resources available within the enterprise, from carrier systems (e.g. location, messaging) and from public resources available through the Internet (e.g. Google maps). As a result, we are witnessing a growing requirement for a number of foundational mobility building blocks, including those that deliver a rich user interface to mobile devices and enable the full web service architecture to be extended to mobile.</p>, <p>MobileAware is leading the way to realize this new approach of converging mobility and SOA, known as Mobile Service Infrastructure. By deploying Mobile Service Infrastructure, enterprise business analysts and developers can rapidly utilize existing enterprise services to create composite mobile applications for offline and online mobile use-cases. Mobile Service Infrastructure enables mobility to become a first-class member of the SOA environment and can now leverage the full array of SOA capabilities, including web services, enterprise service buses, service registries, repositories and composition tools.</p>, <p><strong>MC:</strong> What are some of the issues that are holding back mobile enterprise? It seems that a big issue would be getting everyone on the team on the same network, or in a perfect world the same handset. But are these in fact real issues?</p>, <p><strong>BK:</strong> The issues that are impeding enterprises from fully exploiting mobile devices are indeed the complexity of dealing with different networks and devices. In terms of networks, enterprises need to address network disruption, variable network QoS (Quality of Service), switching between networks and wireless security. In terms of devices, enterprises need to address diverse operating systems, form factors and feature sets. Mobile enterprise vendors are now addressing these issues by providing products that abstract device and network complexity, thus simplifying and reducing the cost of developing and maintaining mobile applications. Increasingly enterprises can be agnostic to the underlying device and network systems.</p>, <p><strong>MC:</strong> Mobile handsets are replaced faster than computers or even PDAs, so how is this going to play in what enterprise can do with mobile?</p>, <p><strong>BK:</strong> We anticipate that enterprises will increasingly support a wider array of devices in terms of application services so that they can engage effectively with customers and executives, in addition to supporting field staff. As a result, enterprises will define policies and will implement a software layer that will operate across devices and networks in an agnostic manner. Enterprises will seek to deploy infrastructure that will insulate their IT systems from device/network diversity and will implement mobile device management policies to support different device stakeholders. Mobility will increasingly be defined in relation to end user and business process requirements, not the underlying mobile technologies.</p>, <p><strong>MC:</strong> Can MobileAware actually reduce the number of devices an on-the-go enterprise employee might need to carry, or is this going to require yet another device to bring along?</p>, <p><strong>BK:</strong> Through the use of MobileAware’s technology, a single mobile device can support multiple application use-cases from mobile web access to sophisticated client-resident mobile ERP applications. However, MobileAware believes in providing choice to the end user in terms of their device preferences. MobileAware’s technology enables enterprises to support end user choice, while at the same time providing a unified and common mobile infrastructure for the enterprise IT systems and applications.</p>, <p><strong>MC:</strong> What are some of the customer deployments that you’ve seen recently? How are companies adapting to what mobile apps can do for them?</p>, <p><strong>BK:</strong> Right across multiple industries, from financial services to telecoms, travel/logistics and government, we are witnessing the deployment of mobile customer and employee applications that are achieving a very impressive return on investment in short time periods. We are seeing a wide variety of business scenarios at present from organizations that are extending their contact centers and enterprise portals to mobile devices to organizations that are extending their core internal business processes to mobile field employees. Instead of relying on vendors to define the mobile business process, enterprises are directly combining their business process tools with mobility technologies to create entirely new mobile business processes that can be refined based on the end user response. Finally, we are increasingly seeing enterprises deploying both internal employee-oriented mobile applications and customer-facing mobile applications from a common set of business resources. Examples of this range from providing mobile check-in services for customers to providing mobile scheduling systems for employees in the travel and transport sector. Most recently, we are seeing a significant update in both mobile client/server and mobile browser-based banking.</p>]"

To: [redacted]@gmail.com</p>, <p>Date: Mon, 15 May 2006 14:54:23 PDT</p>, <p>Dear [redacted],</p>, <p>We appreciate that you chose eBay to list the following listing(s):</p>, <p>[redacted]<br/>
[redacted]<br/>
[redacted]</p>, <p>However, your listing was in violation of eBay’s Inappropriate Links policy and has been removed from eBay.  We have credited all associated fees to your account and notified eBay users associated with the transaction that it has been cancelled.</p>, <p>We would like to take this opportunity to let you know what part of your listing is not permitted.</p>, <p>Your listing(s) contains the following information:</p>, <p>http://www.rapleaf.com/profile/view/[redacted]</p>, <p>http://www.rapleaf.com/profile/view/[redacted]</p>, <p>http://www.rapleaf.com/profile/view/[redacted]</p>, <p>eBay does have complicated rules for what type of outside links may be included within a post (see <a href=""http://pages.ebay.com.au/help/sell/policies.html"">policies here</a>). However, these rules are rarely enforced and there are countless examples of policy breaches that do not result in a listing being terminated. For example, see <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=7616508476"">this listing</a> for the sale of search engine DigForIt, which contains numerous third party links and which also clearly violates eBay’s linking policy.</p>, <p>In this case, it seems clear that eBay does not want Rapleaf’s new reputation system encroaching on their territory. And by banning links to Rapleaf, they may have just given them the marketing push that the new startup needed.</p>]"

Feeds 2.0: A little like Searchfox,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.feeds2.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>There are a number of exciting European startups in the consumer web space that presented at the <a href=""http://www.innovate-events.com/2006/"">Innovate 2006</a> conference in Spain this week, and I’ll be writing about a number of them.</p>, <p>The first is Athens, Greece based <a href=""http://www.feeds2.com/"">Feeds 2.0</a>, a new RSS reader in private beta that reminds me a lot of <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/09/12/searchfox-personalized-rss-reader/"">Searchfox</a>, the <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/01/10/searchfox-to-shut-down/"">now-defunct</a> personalized news reader <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/01/16/yahoo-acquires-searchfox-assets/"">acquired by Yahoo</a> earlier this year.</p>, <p>The reader is definitely rough and in need of further development, but the personalization engine is rock solid and will be popular with some users. Feeds 2.0 monitors what you like and dislike about individual posts in your feed list and presents posts to you based on what it thinks you will want to read next. Attention information comes in via what you read (clicking on the title or expand buttons), what you mark as good (similar to <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/16/rojo-gets-relevant/"">Rojo’s Mojo</a> feature) and what you mark as uninteresting. All of your feedback is run through their algorithm, along with feedback on those posts from other users, to help determine what order your posts are shown to you.</p>, <p>The personalization features alone will be enough to convert some users, but I like Feeds 2.0 for other reasons, too. You can view content on a feed by feed (bloglines) basis, or via a river of news view which ranks all content in reverse chronological order (and by personalization if you have that turned on). They auto-generate descriptive tags for each post, helping you find content via a tag cloud for all unread posts. I’d like to see them add the ability for users to social-tag content as well. But the basic result of the tagging/tag cloud feature, along with personalization, is the ability to quickly find interesting content in a sea of new posts.</p>, <p>One other feature that I’d like to see – a three pane view option which many users, myself included, find to be a superior way to view RSS content.</p>, <p>Also, Feeds 2.0 is available in any of five languages – English, Spanish, French, German and Greek. For non-English speaking users, Feeds 2.0 may be one of the few choices available to them in their first language.</p>, <p>Sign up for the private beta on the <a href=""http://www.feeds2.com"">Feeds 2.0 home page</a>.<br/>

Wii Sensor Bar Useless In The Sunlight?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""center"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/wii_sensor_bar.jpg""/></p>, <p>Well, this could be a problem. I was planning on buying a Wii the day it comes out, and I probably still will, but I will be mucho unhappy if this little rumor is true. A poster in the Nintendo Insider forum writes:</p>, <p>We know that the sensor bar goes all wonky when halogen lights are in the room. But did you know that natural sunlight messes it up too? That’s right, if you have the sun beaming right onto the sensor bar, it doesn’t work. For about an hour or so, the sun shone right into the store, the two MP3:C kiosks had to have curtains above them, and the Wii Sports Tennis and Shooting Game kiosks were unplayable since they were “shrouded” in sunlight. Later the sun went behind a building, and everything was in working order again. So when you get your Wii, don’t play it in the sunlight. Or keep the sensor bar and TV away from the windows.
</p>, <p>The sun glares quite brightly in my apartment at all times, and I could get seriously upset if I can only play in the middle of the night.</p>, <p><a href=""http://forums.nintendo.com/nintendo/board/message?board.id=revolution&amp;message.id=2065592"">My Impressions of the Wii and some games.</a> [Forums.Nintendo.com via <a href=""http://digg.com/gaming_news/Good_old_sunlight_renders_Wii_s_sensor_bar_usless"">Digg</a>]</p>]"
Friendster Mobs – Web Chat Coming,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Since ceding social network dominance to Myspace in 2004, <a href=""http://www.friendster.com"">Friendster</a> has gone through massive <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/02/02/friendster-recapitalized/"">reorganizations</a>, countless consultants and three CEOs. Even a <a href=""http://valleywag.com/tech/kleiner-perkins/scoop-kleiner-perkins-boots-russ-siegelman-169500.php"">Kleiner partner fell</a> due in part to his mismanagement of the company at the board level. However, under the current leadership of Kent Lindstrom, one of the founders (and CFO until taking over early this year), Friendster is making a comeback of sorts.</p>, <p>It turns out the key to making the social network work was pretty simple: creating a scalable architecture that served pages fast, and allowing users a degree of freedom in creating their pages (instead of a rigid hierarchy that leaves all pages looking more or less the same).  The result? A steady and impressive <a href=""http://www.alexaholic.com/friendster.com?y=p&amp;r=6m&amp;z=6"">growth in page views </a>since Kent took over.</p>, <p>So it isn’t unexpected that Friendster would copy yet more features of long time rival Myspace. And instant messaging is next. Myspace<a href=""http://collect.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=im.download""> launched an IM client</a> (Windows only) earlier this month, to generally positive reviews.</p>, <p>Friendster’s version, which is in development, will be web chat, not a downloadable client (“<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/02/19/meebo-more-features-continued-growth/"">Meebo</a>” style).

But it does hurt just a bit that Bloglines actually took away functionality from its simple mobile feeds a while back. It now takes at least three clicks to get to your feeds. And even with EVDO speeds, that’s still a timely process. The rest of the features — save the auto refresh function — still exist in the basic mobile version. But we at Mobile Crunch feel like we’re using the Web version on our Blackberry, when the iPhone is more capable of sizing down Web pages to the big, small screen.

Europe Shows Its Stuff: Innovate 2006,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.innovate-events.com/2006/""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>Dozens of (mostly) European companies showcased their new consumer web applications at <a href=""http://www.innovate-events.com/2006/"">Innovate 2006</a> in Zaragoza, Spain this week. As usual with conferences like these, the companies were young, rough and hungry. And I see a lot of potential with at least a few of them. I’ve summarized my favorites below and look forward to profiling these individually.</p>, <p>Also, I’ve taken a few days to hang out in London with entrepreneurs. If you are here, we are having an open event on Monday, May 22. <a href=""http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=212"">Details are here</a>.</p>, <p>The prevailing topic of conversation at the conference was “Can Europe become more like silicon valley?”. I’m not an expert on this topic, although I’ve lived in London and Copenhagen and have spent a lot of time in Europe over the last few years. But I do have a number of observations. These are generalities, and some of them are applicable to certain geographic areas. The UK, for example, seems to be doing better than the other European countries when it comes to encouraging startups. And a lot of cool stuff is coming out of France even though starting and running a company there is, to say the least, daunting.</p>, <p>First, entrepreneurs in Europe are not revered in the same way as the U.S. Many people in Europe consider entrepreneurs to be greedy and arrogant, trying to reach above themselves. That has to change. Entrepreneurs tend to ignore risk/reward ratios, drive economic growth, bring new jobs to a country. They should be encouraged, not socially chastised</p>, <p>Second, the complexity of creating a corprate entity, hiring employees and raising capital needs to be reduced. It’s simply too hard to create a company and get started.</p>, <p>Third, taxes must come down, or entrepreneurs will continue to flee to the US and elsewhere.</p>, <p>So back to the main reason for this post…here are my favorite companies from the Innovate 2006 conference:</p>, <p><strong>ReadSpeaker</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.readspeaker.com/default.aspx?id=219"">ReadSpeaker</a> is a Spanish company. They provide websites with a plugin that creates a “say it” button on the site. Press the button and the page is read to the reader. Highlight text before pressing the button and just that text is read. Lots of supported languages to choose from.</p>, <p><strong>vPod.tv</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://vpod.tv/"">vPod.tv</a> is headquarted in Paris and Madrid that is yet another video sharing site. I’ll be writing more about them later today, but there is something realy special here. They have a fantastic monetization product, and they are doing things with Flash that I haven’t seen anywhere else. vPod.tv is a company we’ll be hearing a lot more about in the near future. Founder Rodrigo Sepulveda Schulz snagged me after a couple of cocktails at the end of the conference and recorded a videocast <a href=""http://blog.vpod.tv/2006/05/innovateeurope0.html"">here</a> where we discuss the new TechCrunch design, among other things.</p>, <p><strong>Feeds 2.0</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><a href=""http://www.feeds2.com"">feeds2.0</a> is a Greek company that has created a new feed reader with a personalization feature.

This is an unproven market, and there are lots of competitors. The Wakoo site is in French, which will make it impossible for them to enter the U.S. market, but gives them a clear advantage with French bloggers and other French websites.</p>, <p><strong>Digislide</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Australia-based <a href=""http://www.digislide.com.au"">Digislide</a> isn’t a web application, but I loved watching their presentation.

They require a bit of light before they can glow, but Glow Gaming says that the time it takes to load a game will power the controller for a solid half hour. The controllers also feature a longer chord, a “soft touch” feel and acceptable durability. Although the controllers are only available for Playstation 2, Gamecube and Xbox, the company has noted that they will have controllers released later for the Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii and Playstation 3.</p>, <p>I’m not quite sure why someone would actually want a controller that glows in the dark, maybe they took the vampirism aspect of <i>Oblivion</i> a little too seriously.

Today’s Cool Phone is Tomorrow’s Toxic Waste,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""cellphones.jpg"" class=""right"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/cellphones.jpg""/>Yesterday we reported that according to a recent Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association (AMTA) study, very few mobile handsets are actually being recycled. So what is happening to them? Well, landfills are probably where a lot of them are ending up, making for a future environmental disaster.</p>, <p>Even if, as the report suggests, people are actually keeping the phones as backups for now, what is going to happen when users have numerous backups? With the average phone being replaced in 18 months, there are millions of phones that have no where to go. And Jeff Angel, the director of the Total Environment Center (TEC) claims that industry efforts to reclaim disposed phones isn’t working with just three percent of all mobile handsets being recycled.</p>, <p>So what is the solution? Well, one program that has been started is an industry-partnered program with Landcare Australia, where a tree will be planted for every handset recycled. The “Old Phones, New Trees,” program should get the tree-hugger lot involved, but that’s still a long way to go. Another option is a $10 refundable deposit on mobile phones. And there have been other programs suggested such as having to turn in an old phone to keep your number when buying a new phone.</p>, <p>Australian efforts are to boost collections of old phones by 200 percent and halve what goes into landfills within the next three years. That’s a good first step, but there is still a long way to go. And if you think this is bad.

Half of all Calls in Europe Will be Mobile,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""girltalking.jpg"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/girltalking.jpg""/>Soon more people will be doing their talking on mobile handsets than landlines in Europe.

From CTIA President and CEO Steve Largent:</p>, <p>“The FCC’s considerable deliberation over the 700 MHz auction rules has left us pleased in a number of respects and still concerned in others. Specifically, we believe the Commission has taken the appropriate approach by recognizing the importance of not restricting the number of auction entrants, nor requiring them to fulfill wholesale licensing requirements or requiring geographic build-out on all the licenses. In these regards the FCC has replicated past auctions that have led to tremendous benefits for consumers and the U.S. Treasury.</p>, <p>“At the same time, we are disappointed that a significant portion of this valuable spectrum will be encumbered with mandates that could significantly reduce the number of interested bidders. We remain committed to the principle that wireless consumers and American taxpayers are best served when such a valuable commodity is auctioned in a fair and competitive manner with no strings attached, and we commend Commissioner Robert McDowell for his belief in flexible auction rules and the free-market system.</p>, <p>“The competitive wireless marketplace that the FCC has encouraged in the past with market-oriented flexible-use policies has delivered benefits to American consumers that are nothing short of spectacular. The FCC’s deviation from the spectrum auction process that has proven to be so successful in the past could prohibit those benefits from being even more fully realized, and that’s unfortunate.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.ctia.org"">CTIA</a></p>, <p>MobileCrunch continues to monitor this situation and will post comments from any and all interested parties regarding this matter.</p>]"
Linux Can Now Access Silverlight; The Rat Race Between Silverlight and Adobe Flash Continues,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""shot2"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/header-logo.png""/></p>, <p>The open-source, Novell-sponsored <a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page"">Mono Project</a> released Moonlight 1.0, which allows <a href=""http://www.linux.org/"">Linux</a> desktop users to access <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/SILVERLIGHT/"">Microsoft Silverlight</a> content. Novell’s Moonlight also allows Linux users to access Windows multimedia content, including Windows Media Video, Windows Media Audio and MP3 files (all supported through the Microsoft Media Pack). This is one of Microsoft’s first real commitments in participating and supporting an open-source extension of one of their products. Moonlight 1.0 is based on Silverlight 1.0 with Moonlight 2.0 (compatible with Silverlight 2) set to be rolled out later this year.</p>, <p>Silverlight is Microsoft’s platform for rich media applications and was best known for delivering video content for the Bejing 2008 Summer Olympics and as the media platform for the official feed of President’s Obama’s inauguration in January. Linux users were able to use the Moonlight application to watch the inauguration. Silverlight is direct competitor to <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/"">Adobe Flash</a> and the two applications are in a heated battle to gain market share in enabling rich media applications. Linux users have been able to use Flash applications.</p>, <p>There is some debate as to which application is better and whether one or the other is picking up speed. Of course, high profile clients like NBC, the Presidential Inauguration Committee and even the Democratic National Committee (Silverlight was used to stream the Democratic party’s convention proceedings in last year) are helping Microsoft penetrate the market.  <a href=""http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/10/26/macs-getting-netflix-watch-instantly-with-silverlight/"">And we noted that online movie rental service Netflix</a> is using Microsoft Silverlight to allow subscribers to watch movies and TV episodes instantly on their Macs. Mac users were formerly out of luck when it came to watching NetFlix movies on their computers.</p>, <p>But a few weeks ago, Adobe said its AIR and Flash Player 10 applications <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2009/01/29/adobe-air-is-flying-100-million-installations-accounted-for/"">received a record number of downloads </a>in the past year, with AIR receiving more than 100 million installations. Looks like there is no clear cut winner yet.</p>, <p>Moonlight has already proven useful to tens of thousands of Linux users. A pre-release of Moonlight was delivered on January 19, 2009 to allow Linux users to stream Barack Obama’s Inauguration. More than 20,000 Linux users downloaded Moonlight to watch the Silverlight broadcast.</p>]"

vpod.tv Raises $5.1 Million: First Look,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.vpod.tv""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>I mentioned <a href=""http://www.vpod.tv"">vpod.tv</a>, a startup headquartered in Paris and Madrid, in my <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/05/19/europe-shows-its-stuff-innovate-2006/"">Innovate 2006 roundup</a>. Today they are announcing a $5.1 million Series A round, led by <a href=""http://www.innovacom.fr/team_detail.jsp?team=fhumbert"">Frédéric Humbert of Innovacom</a>.</p>, <p>vpod is a “best of class” service, in the<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/04/05/online-video-sites-breeding-like-rabbits/""> rapidly</a> <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/04/02/motionbox-best-online-video-sharing-so-far/"">evolving</a> and <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/05/16/aol-to-release-youtube-clone/"">increasingly crowded</a> video sharing space. <strong>vpod is doing things that no one else is with transcoding, editing/display and monetization.</strong></p>, <p>Frankly, the online video space is getting so crazy that I put off a demo of the product from founders Rodrigo Sepulveda Schulz and Ivan Communod until the end of the conference. The real winner seems to be Adobe – its new Flash development platform is so robust that everyone seems to be developing their own video product, and most are basically variations on the same thing.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>vpod may be different. It’s based in Europe, which will give it an advantage as the U.S. players beat eachother up – they can grow European market share in the meantime. Also, like Revver, vpod is focusing on monetizing videos.</p>, <p>vpod will allow advertisers to easily create advertisements, and play them on their own websites and/or insert them into users’ videos. Ads will be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of videos and will range from 10-60 seconds long. Users can opt out of ads by paying a fee. By opting in, they’ll receive a revenue split from vpod – something in the 50% range. This is further than what competitor Revver has announced to date.</p>, <p>But vpod also shines in other areas. They take video from almost any source and, more importantly, transcode for almost any device. Want Mpeg-4 for the PSP? vpod will let you download that format. Mpeg for the iPod? You can have that too. Just tell vpod your device and it will give you the correct format.</p>, <p>And finally, the tools for creating your own “channel” on vPod are stunning. The only Flash is around the player. Everything else is javascript and dhtml. They allow, for example, resizing of boxes by dragging the mouse, something I’ve only seen in Flash previously.</p>, <p>vpod is in private beta. Sign up on the <a href=""http://www.vpod.tv"">home page</a>. They are allowing people in slowly, ramping up for a fall launch.</p>, <p>In the meantime, if you have some time to kill, check out my after-three-cocktails video interview with Rodrigo <a href=""http://blog.vpod.tv/2006/05/innovateeurope0.html"">here</a>.</p>, <p><strong>Screen shots (<a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/michaelarrington/tags/vpodtv/"">more are here</a>):</strong></p>, <p><span id=""more-1568""></span></p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/vpod2.gif""/><br/>

Feedpass Does Absolutely Nothing,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.feedpass.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>There has been a <a href=""http://www.techmeme.com/060520/p34#a060520p34"">lot of debate</a> about a new service called <a href=""http://www.feedpass.com"">Feedpass</a> over the last couple of days.</p>, <p>Feedpass, like <a href=""http://www.feedburner.com"">Feedburner</a>, will take any RSS feed URL and convert it into something more manageable. For example, I created a TechCrunch feed at Feedpass – <a href=""http://www.feedpass.com/TechCrunch222"">compare it</a> to my <a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/Techcrunch"">standard Feedburner feed</a>.</p>, <p>Feedpass’ value proposition is that they add Google adsense advertisements to the feed landing page (but not into the feed itself), and they will share that revenue with whoever created the feed URL at Feedpass. For example, anyone can create their own TechCrunch feed, distribute it, and get a cut of any adsense revenue generated from it (note that anyone can create a feed on Feedburner from anyone’s RSS, too). This has angered a <a href=""http://www.scripting.com/2006/05/20.html#When:11:21:26PM"">number</a> <a href=""http://www.geeknewscentral.com/archives/006094.html"">of</a> <a href=""http://socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com/2006/05/19/feedpass-makes-rss-subscription-and-monetizing-other-peoples-co/"">bloggers</a> who see it as hijacking their content for commercial purposes (which is exactly what it is). As an example, someone, not me, created <a href=""http://www.feedpass.com/TechCrunch"">this version</a> of the TechCrunch feed. Any clicks on ads on that page do not result in revenue flowing through to TechCrunch.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>If you actually claim the blog, showing that you own the content, you will receive a higher cut of the advertising revenue (2/3 instead of the basic 1/3). This does not, however, stop people from creating other versions of your feed on Feedpass and distributing it for their own gain.</p>, <p>There are a number of legal and other issues that the Feedpass model raises. Is it fair use, or copyright infringement? I don’t know, I’m not an IP attorney. Is it ethical? I don’t think it’s particularly unethical. The posts within the feed clearly point back to the original content, so we aren’t in splog territory. But it definitely leaves a bad taste in my mouth.</p>, <p>In the end this just can’t compete with Feedburner, a much more robust solution for publishers. Feedburner provides stats and other tools that Feedpass doesn’t have at this time. And adding ads to the landing page for a feed isn’t that interesting, either, because the <strong>point of that RSS landing page is to turn the visitor into an RSS subscriber, not to generate revenue</strong> (Feedburner, I noticed, has dropped their <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/12/07/is-feedburner-pushing-the-envelope-on-trust/"">one ad from that page</a>, good for them). Note: if Feedpass inserted Google adsense ads directly into the feed, things might be more interesting from a publisher standpoint.</p>, <p>So in the end I’m not particularly outraged, I’m just ambivalent (as is <a href=""http://mashable.com/2006/05/20/feedpass-rss-landing-pages/"">Pete Cashmore</a>). Feedpass has now had its 15 minutes of fame – I don’t think we’ll be hearing much more from them.</p>, <p>Feedburner, however, has a very real new competitor coming soon. More on that this week.<br/>

IBM Uses Amazon To Leapfrog Microsoft On The Way To The Blue Cloud,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""shot2"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ibm_amazon.png""/></p>, <p>IBM is advancing its aggressive cloud computing strategy with a string of announcements this week. The most recent was IBM’s partnership with Amazon Web Services to allow access of its software to solution providers using Amazon’s cloud computing applications. The partnerships offers pay-as-you-go access to development and production versions of IBM Information Management database servers, IBM Lotus content management, and IBM WebSphere portal and middleware products through Amazon’s EC2 cloud computing service. The partnership makes sense because Amazon has been an early leader in the cloud computing sphere, and IBM is making strides towards becoming the master of cloud computing. Microsoft is readying its own cloud-computing software service, Windows Azure, that will allow developers to create services and applications that are supported by Microsoft’s data centers.</p>, <p>IBM is also providing free Amazon Machine Images of its software applications for development and test purposes, in an effort to enable software developers to quickly build applications based on IBM software within Amazon EC2. IBM also said that its Tivoli service management software will be used on Amazon EC2 to help clients control the infrastructures in the cloud computing sphere.</p>, <p>Amazon expanded on the reasoning behind this deal on its <a href=""http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2009/02/ibm-software-now-available-on-payasyougo-basis.html"">Web Services blog</a>:</p>, <p>“Existing IBM customers can use the licenses they’ve already bought while still taking advantage of the elastic nature of AWS to handle spikes and peaks. These licenses retain their value and can be used to handle steady state processing needs, with more licenses available (on an hourly basis) in the cloud for peak times. This clean and innovative new model should clear up some of the uncertainty which can cause potential users to think twice before jumping in to cloud computing. “</p>, <p>So the implication here is that IBM is using Amazon as supplier to play in the cloud computing sphere and is also pricing the transition so that it is easy for existing customers to switch to cloud computing. IBM has been making aggressive moves towards making its mark in the cloud computing sphere, <a href=""http://www.techcrunchit.com/2009/02/09/ibm-and-juniper-networks-hoping-to-gain-cloud-computing-marketshare/"">including its recent partnership with Juniper Networks </a> to offer cloud computing services to IBM clients, which we reported on earlier this week.

Chuck E. Cheese Creator Opens First uWink Restaurant,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/><br/>
Nolan Bushnell, founder and former CEO of Atari and Chuck E. Cheese, announced that the first uWink restaurant will open Monday, October 16th, in Woodland Hills, California. What’s uWink you ask? Well like all good dining franchise experiences, it distracts you from the quailty of your dining companions and the food with a gimmick; uWink does it by letting you turn your meal into a social networking event. After all, why waste time interacting with the people you’re with when you can use “uWink’s proprietary network and entertainment software, including the uWink Game Library.” Why hell, you don’t even have to talk to the pesky wait staff since you order food, drinks and media directly via touchscreens at your table.</p>, <p>
We almost forgot to mention, the restaurant is split into “Activity Zones.”</p>, <p>Zone 1 – the Patio<br/>
Active both day and night, the patio is the place where guests can exercise their choice to enjoy their evening outside. Passerbs will certainly notice guests have fun at their table and the large exterior monitor reflects all fun being had inside. The entry and host areas provide the introduction to a whole new dining experience.<br/>
Zone 2 – Studio A<br/>
Visible from the entry host, this smaller room provides a more intimate dining experience. Comfortable booths at the edges and smaller dining tables with chairs provide a variety of seating and at the table entertainment options.<br/>
Zone 3 – Studio Bar<br/>
The central bar and lounge area features the most active drinking and entertainment experience. A few steps above the main dining areas, the bar provides a great place to see and be seen and home to the 6 player PARTY TABLE, our social interaction lubricant game.<br/>
Zone 4 – Studio C<br/>
The largest of the dining experience features a formal presidium stage and a variety of seating options. Ideal for the table-to-table and room play this area also can become an instant quiz show venue or presentation stage.</p>, <p>We’re sure this franchise idea will spread like herpes at a college kegger, but that doesn’t make it right. </p>, <p>

Well this leaked Samsung SGH-i760 Windows Mobile 5 for Pocket PC Smartphone with slide-out QWERTY keyboard looks like the Hershey Big Block to the T809’s Miniature. The specs look pretty freakin’ tasty with Bluetooth, 802.11g wireless, microSD slot, 2.8-inch QVGA touchscreen, 2-megapixel camera, 3G/HSDPA tri-band support, and the ability to make forward-facing video calls. That keyboard looks nice and spacious, too.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/smartphones/samsung-sghi760-smartphone-has-brains-beauty-206778.php"">Samsung SGH-i760: Smartphone Has Brains, Beauty</a> [Gizmodo Via <a href=""http://www.modaco.com/index.php?showtopic=247282"">MoDaCo</a>]</p>]"
Holes in iPhone Security Patched,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""iPhonebandaid.jpg"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/iPhonebandaid.jpg""/>It seems that <em>some</em> Apple users like to point out that their rivals always seem to have security holes? So what do <em>those</em> Apple users have to say now? This week Apple Inc. issued a software patch for the newly released iPhone to address a few small security holes. This software update was released late Tuesday, and it addressed the security issues as well as few bugs. It also is meant to fix the flaw that could have allowed hackers to take control of the multimedia cell phone to spread spam or steal data if the owner visited a hi-jacked Web site or Wi-Fi hotspot.</p>, <p>The thing is that this isn’t surprising. New operating systems and devices are going to have holes, and there will always be patches. But as a non-Apple user (no Mac, no iPhone, no iPod in my home) I’m not happy to hear there are holes. That’s not good for anyone. But I am happy whenever holes are patched. So rather than make fun of any company’s efforts to plug holes, we should be happy they found it for too many of the bad guys.</p>, <p><a href=""http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070802/iphone_security.html?.v=1"">[Via AP]</a></p>]"
Google PPC Video Ads – Why I'm Betting Against It,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Google will launch a new pay-per-click video ad product and syndicate it out through its Adsense Network today. Like Google’s normal text ads, Advertisers will bid for placement and will be charged when a user clicks on the video. A graphic will appear on the website displaying the ad. The Google blog post on the product is <a href=""http://adwords.blogspot.com/2006/05/click-to-play-video-ads-for-adwords.html"">here</a>. Worse, it appears that publishers that show adsense ads cannot opt out of showing video ads.</p>, <p>Here’s my initial impression: this won’t be popular for advertisers, publishers or viewers.</p>, <p>First, Google needs to eat its own dogfood. It won’t be placing these ads on their own sites for now. Why? Perhaps their early testing showed that consumers don’t want to click on these nearly as often as significantly less intrusive text ads. Or perhaps Google just doesn’t want to sully its super-clean site with this stuff. Either way, without Google search, advertisers will be significantly less interested in the product.</p>, <p>Second. When someone clicks on a video, they <em>aren’t</em> clicking through to a website, where some sort of action can occur that can be tied to an ROI. People like Adsense becasue it can result in sales or other trackable actions. Videos don’t do that. Even though the web is making multi-media drop dead easy, people still like text (and that’s why blogs are interesting to a lot more people than podcasts).</p>, <p>Third, small businesses already have a wonderful way of getting normal television ad spots produced and run. <a href=""http://www.spotrunner.com/"">SpotRunner</a> will help small businesses create an ad and run it on normal television for extremely low prices ($44 for ESPN in central California, for example).</p>, <p>Fourth, people don’t want to click on video ads. They don’t want to watch this stuff at all, really. And if a company comes up with a really cool ad, like <a href=""http://www.videoclipstream.com/akamai/h-l/honda/"">Honda’s wonderful “Cog” ad</a>, it’ll spread virally. They don’t need to pay users to watch it.</p>, <p>Fifth, Producing a video ad takes work. It’s easier than it used to be, but it takes a lot longer than producing a text ad. Only a fraction of the Adsense advertiser base will be willing and/or able to participate. This will drive down the auctioned ad prices per keyword significantly.</p>, <p>Sixth, all of these factors are going to contribute to low PPC and click through rates. Adsense partners won’t make as much money as they would from normal text ads, and I suspect these ads will take up more space (and the graphical nature will make it much more intrusive and disruptive to a web site look and feel). Publishers won’t adopt this.</p>, <p>My bet is that, like Google’s <a href=""http://www.yardley.ca/blog/index.php/archives/2005/11/23/google-tests-out-click-to-call-adwords/"">Click To Call experiment</a> where people could click a button and call a business from their computer (making their home phone ring), this will fade quietly into the background.</p>, <p>And in the meantime, whether I’m right or wrong, Google needs to provide a mechanism for publishers showing adsense ads to opt out of showing videos.</p>, <p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=""http://virtualeconomics.typepad.com/virtualeconomics/2006/05/google_and_that.html"">Seamus McCauley</a> has some intelligent thoughts on this as well, and mentions both the languishing click-to-call product as well as the now dead Google print experiment.

New Features at Live.com Local Maps,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://local.live.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>The online map wars continue to escalate, as Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Ask.com and Mapquest compete to release new features – some aimed at <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/11/02/new-yahoo-maps-shows-power-of-flash/"">usability</a>, and some designed to be <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/02/28/killer-new-livecom-service-street-side/"">just plain sexy</a>.  We <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/04/17/comparing-the-mapping-services/"">compared the online maps last month</a> and thought Yahoo was the best overall, based largely on the inclusion of traffic data and the flexibility of their APIs. <strong>This morning, Microsoft will swing back with <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/may06/05-23WLLaunchPR.mspx"">significant upgrades</a> to its own <a href=""http://local.live.com/"">Live.com Local</a> maps product.</strong></p>, <p>Currently Live.com offers a wide variety of viewing options: “Road” (normal maps view), “Aerial” (satellite and high altitude airplane pictures), “Bird’s Eye” (low level aircraft, at an angle) and “<a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/02/28/killer-new-livecom-service-street-side/"">Street Side</a>”, a visually stunning street level view of the map. Apart from Street Side, users can toggle between the three viewing options, zeroing in on their intended location.</p>, <p>Microsoft Virtual Earth Program Manager Steve Lombardi walked me through the new and upgraded features late yesterday and sent me some screen shots which I have included here. In summary, the changes include:</p>, <p><span id=""more-1604""></span></p>, <p><strong>Collections</strong></p>, <p>Currently, pushpins can be added to specific points on a Live Local map. Pushpins are stored in a browser cookie, but not otherwise saved, and there is a limit of ten pushpins total.</p>, <p>Now, pushpins can be stored permanently by Microsoft if you sign in with your Live.com credentials, and can be categorized into any number of topics. The limit on the number of pushpins has been eliminated as well. Each pushpin can have a title and description, and a picture can be associated with it (via URL for now, and Live Local will store photos for you in the near future). Each collection of pushpins has a URL and can be set to public or private at the user’s discretion. The pushpins also remain present as the user toggles through different view settings.</p>, <p>There are a number of interesting applications for this. See, for example, <a href=""http://flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=152230763&amp;context=photostream&amp;size=o"">this screenshot</a> of a group of favorite music venues in Seattle. Other uses could be a group of restaurant reviews, shared with friends, etc.</p>, <p>The Collections feature is also now integrated with <a href=""http://favorites.live.com"">Live Favorites</a> (an early social bookmarking product). A public Live Local Collection can be saved by any user in Live Favorites as well, with links back to Live Local maps.<br/>
<strong><br/>
Traffic Flow Information</strong></p>, <p>Microsoft is also adding traffic flow information. Previously, Yahoo was the only major maps service to offer this service.</p>, <p>Traffic information is provided through a partnership with traffic.com. Also, unlike Yahoo, which provides only incident reports, Microsoft is providing full traffic flow information, on both sides of major streets and highways.</p>, <p>The best way to understand the difference is to see it visually. The Yahoo and Live Local maps below show the same journey, from my house to San Francisco airport. Yahoo is on top and shows reported incidents with an exclamation point. Microsoft, bottom, also shows incidents, but uses a color coded scheme (green = good flow, red = traffic) to show traffic flow throughout the journey, on both sides of the highway. For an additional screenshot, see <a href=""http://flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=152231177&amp;context=photostream&amp;size=o"">this image</a> that shows traffic on one side of a bridge, but not the other, along with a link to a local traffic camera (set as a pushpin).</p>, <p>Yahoo Maps showing basic traffic information is on top. A Live Local map with enhanced traffic data is below:</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/trafficcomp.gif""/></p>, <p><strong>Bird’s Eye View: Now Includes UK</strong></p>, <p>Live Local’s Bird’s Eye View, which provides multi-angled photographs from low flying aircraft, has now expanded to include large parts of the UK. While central London is not yet available, Steve did send me a screen shot, below, showing Dover Castle (a screen shot showing a different angle <a href=""http://flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=152231898&amp;size=o"">is here</a>).

SMS Forum Disbands,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""smsforum.jpg"" class=""right"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/smsforum.jpg""/>This week the SMS Forum, a non-profit organization devoted to the developing and promoting SMS to benefit the wireless industry, announced it will be disbanding. The group will take down its Web site by the end of this year. Originally founded as the Short Message Peer to Peer Forum, the group changed to SMS Forum and had been going strong sine 2001.

The Open Process,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""openlock"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-1607"" height=""202"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/openlock.jpg"" title=""openlock"" width=""292""/>A common gambit in the open standards arena is the invite-only event. This is where a group of developers, marketing types, and entrepreneurs decide the time is right to codify their work in a momentum play. Such a moment presented itself this week when an OpenID UI event was held at the Facebook offices in Palo Alto.</p>, <p>OpenID has achieved extraordinary amounts of promotion, contributions, and adoption in the past year. The group presenting this private event was in large part responsible for this success, but with some important caveats. Open standards is as much if not more about politics than technology, and some of the political players such as Dave Winer and Marc Canter were left out of the loop.</p>, <p>Also, the members of the core group include folks who work for some of the major platform vendors in the space, and it can become difficult to separate out the open aspects of this subtle world from the spin that inevitably accompanies the information and innovation. The stated purpose of this particular event was to encourage a discussion about user interface issues in hopes of moving more quickly and effectively than a larger open group.</p>, <p>After some pointed comments by Winer and a FriendFeed thread, the event was “opened” to streaming video and a chat room for feedback. A back channel email thread started by Canter added some interested bystanders including some participation from the Identity Internet Workshop where OpenID and OAuth were given significant support in the early days. But those in charge of the event held firm on the original closed intent of the session, discussing further more open events but offering no commitments.</p>, <p>Aside from the obvious irony of a closed event about Open standards, the actual procedings produced an exciting demo of an experimental wiring up of Plaxo and Google in two clicks. While there was a tenuous relationship to a UI experience, the success of a project that had been demonstrated in an earlier open event at Digg headquarters produced palpable optimism that real progress was being made.</p>, <p>In retrospect, the organizers succeeded in promoting their agenda, with all of its attendant good vibes about open source, open standards, and a more up-to-date process for bringing competitors into alignment in the Web 3.0 space. But they failed by making the mistake of connecting their valuable and generous efforts to a process that at a minimum brings their motives into question.</p>, <p>Why should such a meeting be private? It raises the question: who is not invited, and why. The answer that came back was one of purpose and expertise, that those who were actively working in the space would be welcome. Coders, marketers, organizers, representatives of major platforms. Makes sense, but why would those not invested in the event want to come in any case. Well, because they are invested.</p>, <p>The history of open standards is rife with examples of a curious alliance between the media and the outsiders of a process. First, it is interesting, newsworthy, challenging of orthodoxy and entropy, the very forces that retard more hierarchical organizations such as the ones the Open Stack organizers are trying to improve upon. And again, if this needs to be repeated, the history of profoundly disruptive technologies such as XML, RSS, Twitter, and indeed everything about the current Web x.0 landscape comes in significant part from the combination of the bigcos and the so-called outsiders to the process.</p>, <p>It’s more than a little ironic that the organizers of this event include Chris Messina, whose central role in routing around similar issues with private events led to BarCamp and all of his fine work in the Open stack. His response to concerns from those not invited (a large group if you take into account the world population) was to categorize (my paraphrase) those concerns as noise. Messina’s election to the board of the OpenID Foundation is deserved and a significant moment in the evolution of his and the others’ efforts, but now is not the time to climb on board the Ark and pull up the ladders.</p>, <p>The 92% demo and its clear signal that users are ready for coherent agreements with vendors about who owns their data (users) is a signal moment in the open evolution of the network. At a time when Microsoft is mandating openness in its core strategy, when Google and other vendors are profiting handsomely on technologies built via open source, when YouTube and Ustream and a thousand endpoints are blooming with direct worldwide access at virtually no cost to ideas, innovation, and a way out of this economic disaster we’re bearing — now is the time for systems that include rather than pick and choose winners.</p>, <p>Of course, you can go the old route and lock down the intellectual property, choose your business partners and favored suppliers, and so on. But if you build your enterprise on an open API platform and then close the barn door, the after-taste can be difficult to get rid of. Trying to hold back the Web doesn’t work, and those who succeed by understanding that have to renew their vows each day. That’s the ticket for admission to the Open Process.</p>]"

"Sony MDR-D777LP Altus Headphones For Listening To Stuff At 80KHz, Not That You Actually Can","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/></p>, <p>The headline may express a certain lack of enthusiasm, but these new headphones from Sony look pretty sweet considering their price tag is $149. The MDR-D777LP Altus headphones have closed earcups, however they feature an “ambient sound-in switch” that lets you hear external noise like open-type cups would, such as that car coming at you that’s about to run that red and nail your ass in the crosswalk. The “aura-nomic” design (a word I’m pretty sure Sony made up) promises extreme comfort thanks to ear-and-head cushioning, and a single-sided cord, which aren’t used on nearly enough higher-end headphones. Since these are made to be mobile, Sony made them collapseable and includes a pouch for storage. Finally, the 40mm high-definition driver units with Neodymium magnets produce sound from 8Hz to 80KHz and are angeled parallel to your eardrum to reduce pressure–features you don’t find regularly in portable headphones. </p>, <p>

Wines are browseable by type (red, white, etc.), variety and region. I’d like to be able to browse by winery as well. Clicking on tags from there will show other wines I might like, too. Another nit: when you leave a comment on a wine, it does not appear in your wine log. you have to leave a separate comment there. There are also a few navigation bugs.</p>, <p>But overall, I like the site and the service.

The Top 10 Annoying Things About Next Gen,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""center"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/chboxguykutaragi5iv.jpg""/></p>, <p>The bashing, ranting, and rumors of the console wars have begun – and only one of the three next gen consoles is out on the market. If you’re already sick of hearing about the console wars, you better tune out of video games for a while until every gamer ends up owning every console. Maybe then there will be some kind of peace among us. Until that happens, Unfettered Blather has posted a list of the top 10 annoying things about next gen, starting with:</p>, <p>10. <b>Still waiting for Next Gen to arrive</b><br/>
When the Xbox 360 hit the market I thought, “It’s here! It’s here!” Boy was I excited. With the last generation of the console wars clearly won by Sony I was ready to see how the new competition was going to shape up. So far it hasn’t shaped up at all. Microsoft has their team on the field and the other two teams are still in training camp.</p>, <p>Read the other nine and give CrunchGear your list of top 10 annoying things about next gen! <span id=""more-1626""></span></p>, <p>9. <b>Letting Microsoft define the Next Gen market</b><br/>
Microsoft has a ten mile head start in a fifty mile marathon. That means there is still plenty of time to overtake them, but that’s still one hell of a lead. No matter how you look at it, Microsoft has essentially placed the next generation on their terms. Everyone else has to play catch up.</p>, <p>8. <b>Stupid name changes</b><br/>
With Nintendo’s revolutionary ideas, revolutionary control, and an approach to the console market that leverages their position as a smaller, more flexible, and more innovative company, they had the perfect name for their console. Instead they decide to change the name to something that will inspire pee jokes for the next ten years. Brilliant, just brilliant! The best part is realizing the person who came up with the name “Wii” probably makes more money than I do. [<i>Oh there’s no doubt. – Ed.</i>]</p>, <p>7. <b>$60 games</b><br/>
With Microsoft facing little competition, they can charge whatever they want. Gamers have been complaining about the high cost of games for awhile, and raising prices doesn’t seem like a smart move to me. After all, it doesn’t matter how much a game costs because the price is pretty much fixed upon release, so the amount of copies sold means everything. Even so, the next gen market is still small so Microsoft needs to get the most for each game it can. Besides, it’s not like anyone else is out there fighting them. Expect this trend to continue till after Christmas when all the consoles are released and retail hits their usual yearly sales slump.</p>, <p>6. <b>Microsoft’s Multiple Personality Disorder</b><br/>
Probably not Microsoft’s fault really, but it is fun watching titles getting released on the Xbox 360, the Xbox, and PC all at the same time. I need the 360 why?</p>, <p>5. <b>Who needs backwards compatibility anyway?</b><br/>
It was the mini-trend we hardly knew. Once we saw the PS2 could play Playstation games it seemed like we had a sure thing on our hands, especially with Microsoft being the kings of backwards compatibility with Windows. Alas, it seems all for naught. A major selling point for alot of these consoles would be the ability to still play all your own games, but for whatever reason the development teams just couldn’t figure it out. I still wonder if the 360’s compatibility problems are as bad as people make it out to be, but gamers are clearly not satisfied, and Sony’s mewlings aren’t building any confidence.</p>, <p>4. <b>Chasing Nintendo</b><br/>
You can’t just ignore changes in the industry, but it sure is fun watching these two mega-corporations scrambling to keep up with Nintendo’s ideas. Of course it’s one thing to respond to change, it’s entirely different to come up with new innovations of your own. Nintendo is playing smarter this generation, will they keep it up?</p>, <p>3. <b>Cost between consoles and computers vanishing</b><br/>
$60 games? Expensive peripherals? Consoles being released at a $600 price point? Anyone notice that desktop computers just continue to go down in price despite becoming ever more powerful? Consoles still have a lot of advantages over PC’s, but the most powerful incentive of console games is weakening.</p>, <p>2. <b>Dual price SKU nonsense</b><br/>
“You can buy our system or you can spend $100 less to get a castrated system. Wow! Are we a great company or what?”</p>, <p>1. <b>Sony’s Alternate Reality</b><br/>
No matter how you spin it, we still just want a game console first. Go push your format war somewhere else.</p>]"

Use Farecast To Find Flight Deals (or just fly Southwest),"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.farecast.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>Seattle-based <a href=""http://www.farecast.com"">Farecast</a>, now in private beta, is an airfare pricing comparision tool that also uses a predictive algorithm to recommend <em>when</em> you buy your ticket. So the idea is to show the user not just who has the cheapest ticket, but whether or not waiting might make sense as well. Look for Minneapolis-based <a href=""http://www.flyspy.com"">Flyspy</a> to launch a similar service in the near future.</p>, <p>The site is well designed and the interface clearly communicates pricing and predictive information. At this point in the beta you must choose Seattle or Boston as the departure city, so I looked at Seattle – Los Angeles flights. The cheapest option was $329 (on American Airlines), and Farecast tells me with 80% certainty that the lowest fares will rise by $50 over the next seven days.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Ok, great. But Southwest, which has flights for $308 round trip, isn’t included in the price comparison. And that’s the real problem here. Farecast is a nice solution that distills useful information from complete pricing chaos by the airlines. But Southwest doesn’t play those games, and doesn’t open their service up to comparison engines like Farecast. So the lowest and most understandable prices are excluded from the service.</p>, <p>While I like Farecast, and will use it to see if I can get a flight for less than Southwest charges, what I’d really like to see is our airlines pull their collective head out of their collective ass and adopt a pricing model that makes sense. One, for instance, that doesn’t require a proprietary algorithm like Farecast’s to understand.</p>, <p><a href=""http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/271522_farecast25.html?source=rss"">John Cook</a> has more.

Musings On Share Your OPML,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://share.opml.org""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a><a href=""http://share.opml.org"">Share Your OPML</a> is already a good blog ranking system, and over time it has the chance to become the definitive ranking and recommendation system for blogs. And when I say that, I’m thinking the very long tail of blogs, not just the top 100 or even 1,000</p>, <p>In my <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/05/07/share-your-opml/"">original post</a> describing the service, there were a number of commenters who complained this was just another A-List ranking system. Right now, that’s what it is – <a href=""http://share.opml.org/rankings/"">another top 100 list</a>, little different in actual results than the Technorati 100 and other lists of the most popular blogs out there.</p>, <p>But there’s a real difference between what Share Your OPML is doing and other ranking systems. SYO is completely objective and shows exactly what content people are actually reading right now. Other ranking systems are either subjective, or forced to look at either different data (Technorati looks at links) or only data specific to their users (Bloglines ranks blogs based on subscriber numbers on Bloglines). Over time, SYO can become a true “long tail” recommendation engine if a wide swath of the users out there are willing to upload their OPML feed. And they are only a couple of steps away from being there.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>SYO needs more users. My guess is a few thousand have already uploaded their reading lists, but it will take a lot more before the data is really reflective of what most people are reading. To do this, SYO needs to add more value than it currently does for users. New features have been rolling out over time that help do this. Since the last time I looked, SYO has added a <a href=""http://share.opml.org/toppodcasts/"">top podcast list</a> and a <a href=""http://share.opml.org/aggregator/"">feed reader</a> to the mix.</p>, <p>One way to get more people using SYO is to encourage feed readers like Bloglines to allow people to keep their permanent OPML file at SYO instead of at the reader. This is probably a long way off for Bloglines, the market leader for web based readers. But it is probably something that smaller and newer readers will adopt if encouraged, and if the functionality to make this easy exists at SYO. Well, I’m encouraging them. I want all of my feeds kept in one neutral place. SYO is a good place to do that.</p>, <p>But first I need more functionality. I want to tag my feeds (and tag other’s feeds). I like how <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/05/25/jeff-pulvers-feedcollectors-beta/"">FeedCollectors</a> does this, and I think SYO should emulate them. My permanent feeds have a permanent URL at SYO <a href=""http://share.opml.org/viewsharedfeeds/?user_id=42"">here</a>. I’d like to have a permanent URL for each tag, too, by user or by all users (Flickr does this exactly).</p>, <p>I also need better recommendations. SYO shows me the feeds of users who closely match what I already read. I’d like to see specific recommendations for each feed, too. So if I like to read Scripting News, SYO can tell me what else I might like. This is easy to do with all of the data available at SYO. They just need to build the algorithm and launch it.</p>, <p>This is where the real excitement begins for me. Sure, SYO can list the top 100, or 100,000 feeds and it will be interesting to see where a particular feed falls in popularity. But what I really want to know is what feeds I should be reading based on what I already like. That’s where newer, less popular blogs can get a boost. If only a few people read them now, others will be able to find them via the recommendation engine. And the blogosphere will be a better place.</p>]"
Home On iPod Returns In Apple Patent Filing,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/><br/>
Ever wish you could just take your computer’s entire Home directory with you on a portable drive, and then sit down at any computer, plug in your drive and access everything? Well, those were Apple’s plans back in 2003, by including a feature in Mac OS X 10.3 Panther dubbed “Home on iPod.” However, the component was inexplicably removed from pre-release builds of the OS.</p>, <p>
AppleInsider has turned up a new patent filing from Apple for the feature, though, so there’s hope the project is still in the works. From the snippets of product descriptions AppleInsider posted, it sounds like an incredible tool.</p>, <p>“When you find yourself near a Panther-equipped Mac, just plug in the iPod, log in, and you’re ‘home,’ no matter where you happen to be,” the description continued. “And when you return to your home computer, you can synchronize any changes you’ve made to your files by using File Sync, which automatically updates offline changes to your home directory.”</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=2130""><br/>

Yodlee Announces SMS Banking Solution,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""yodlee.jpg"" class=""right"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/yodlee.jpg""/>SMS can now be used for mobile banking and to make payments. Today Yodlee Inc. announced that it launched a new SMS banking capability for its Yodlee Mobile Solution. Yodlee Mobile SMS alerts can help customers avoid overdraft fees, while users can use the service to check balances, review transaction, view spending reports and even make emergency bill payments.</p>, <p>”It’s clear that mobile banking strategies need to incorporate at least two key elements: 1.) ubiquity of access via multiple channels and 2.) relevant, personal content that delivers what consumers really need when they’re on the go,” said Peter Hazlehurst, SVP of product development at Yodlee. “Yodlee is addressing both these needs with a wide distribution channel (users can access their content via a mobile web browser, SMS), and by leveraging our core strength: secure access to virtually all financial accounts in a simple mobile interface.”</p>, <p>Yodlee Mobile offers SMS/text messaging capability as well as WAP browser functionality.<br/>

Limbo Auctions: Gimmick or the Real Deal?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.41414.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a><a href=""http://www.41414.com/"">Limbo</a> is a San Mateo, California startup with funding from Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Azure Capital. The purpose of the service is to auction off things like plasma TVs, iPods, cars and event tickets, with bids being placed via text messages. The hook is that the winner of the item isn’t the highest bidder. The winner of each auction is the person with the lowest <em>unique</em> bid for that auctioin, meaning no other person bid that exact amount. If lots of people bid $0.01 and you are the only person bidding $0.02, you win.</p>, <p>The company is quick to issue press releases around the incredible deals that winner’s managed to get. <a href=""http://www.41414.com/pr20060502.php"">This press release</a>, for example, talks about a Salt Lake City woman named Sondra Peterson who won a $35,000 Hummer on a bid of $36.65.</p>, <p>It’s not quite that simple, of course, or Limbo wouldn’t have much of a business model. Bids must be placed via text message or via regular phone. I placed a bid on the 42 inch plasma TV and it required a total of four messages – two sent and two received, to finalize it. Based on my pricing plan, that’s $0.22 on my cell phone bill, some of which Limbo will receive in revenue share. Also, the TV is a Limbo premium auction, which means I was charged an additional $0.99 for my bid. That’s a total cost to me of $1.21, and Limbo is going for more: my last text message said</p>, <p>“Too High! Your bid of 1938c is unique, but there are 265 lower unique bids. Bid again? Rply “HDTB XX” where XX is yr bid in cents. *Bid award: 10 Loot”</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>If I place another bid, another round of text messages will be billed to my phone along with another $0.99 bid charge. With all of these charges it isn’t hard to see how Limbo can become profitable on a per auction basis. All of these “loot” points are designed to get me to bid often as well. You get these each time you bid, and they can be <a href=""http://www.41414.com/store.php?range=x"">traded in</a> for tshirts and other items once you’ve accumulated enough of them.</p>, <p>If you aren’t skeptical enough after understanding the basics, the <a href=""http://www.41414.com/faqs.php"">fine print </a>may be enough to keep you away.</p>, <p>Auctions run for a very long time (the TV auction runs from May 15 to June 5. Such a long auction period means there will be a lot of bids, and the chances of winning go down dramatically. Once you place a bid you are automatically going to receive a text message every time a new auction occurs, which you can opt out of only by sending another text message. If you use your home phone, things may be even worse. Limbo <a href=""http://www.41414.com/privacy.php"">explicitly states</a> that they will use your information for marketing purposes. Expect tele-sales calls.</p>, <p>And if you win, shipping isn’t free. You will be charged normal UPS rates on the item (or alternatively you can give them rights you use your picture for promotional purposes). And finally, you will be taxed on the difference between the value of the item and what you actually paid as normal income. So that Hummer that Sondra Peterson won cost her a lot more than $36.65. Not only was she taxed on $35,000 in income, but I can’t imagine what the UPS shipping charges on a Hummer might be. :-)</p>, <p>So all in all, the vast majority of bidders will be paying Limbo without any meaningful chance of winning, they will be subjecting themselves to numerous SMS and other fees, they will be giving explicit consent to use their phone numbers for marketing purposes, and the winners are forced to pay out of pocket fees for taxes and shipping of the item. So, after trying out the service and reading the detailed rules, Limbo seems like more of a gimmick to me (and a costly one) than a chance to get cool stuff for nearly free.</p>]"
Fake Nokia Handsets Seized in India,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""india.jpg"" class=""right"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/india.jpg""/>It isn’t uncommon to find counterfeit goods coming out of India, but last weekend Indian policed seized fake Nokia mobile phones worth approximately $40,000. The Indian government received a tip-off from the Nokia staff, and a total of ninety handsets were found at a warehouse in the Watgunge, just outside Kolkata.</p>, <p>The investigation suggests that the mobile handsets may have come from Delhi, and likely would have been shipped to shops across the country.</p>, <p>What isn’t clear is whether the phones, which would be sold without valid papers, would work just like the N-series. It is also unclear whether the phones utilized the same type of chips or cellular circuits as real N-series phones from Nokia.<br/>

CNET's AllYouCanUpload Is Disruptive,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://allyoucanupload.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>CNET very quietly launched a simple new photo uploading site called <a href=""http://allyoucanupload.com/"">AllYouCanUpload</a> last week. At first glance it doesn’t appear to be very special or disruptive. But it is.</p>, <p>By launching AllYouCanUpload, CNET just pulled the rug out from under at least two startups (<a href=""http://www.photobucket.com"">photobucket</a> and <a href=""http://www.imageshack.us"">imageshack</a>) that focus on providing image hosting for users who want to display those images on other websites, like Myspace, eBay and others. This is a big business – <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/04/19/2-of-us-internet-traffic-through-photobucket/"">a lot of traffic flows through photobucket</a> today, and it is a profitable and <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/05/14/photobucket-closes-105-from-trinity-ventures/"">well funded</a> company.</p>, <p>AllYouCanUpload is a site that makes uploading photos as easy as it can possibly get. They’ve removed all of the friction. You do not need to register for an account. You just use the uploading tool and you are shown the image along with codes to post the photo on sites like Myspace, ebay and others (I’d also like an option to have the image links emailed to me). Unlike Photobucket and Imageshack, AllYouCanUpload is completely free, and no advertisements appear on the uploading areas of the site (there are ads on the hosted part of the site, which you see if you click on a hosted image). There is no limit to the number of photos that can be uploaded or the total amount of storage that may be consumed. There is no limit on the size of an image, and images are not resized unless you request it. And possibly most importantly, there are absolutely no bandwidth restraints.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>This last point is important. With other services there are caps on bandwidth. That means if a photo is particularly popular and is viewed a lot, the user account will be shut down after a cap is reached. That won’t happen with AllYouCanUpload.</p>, <p>This is not a destination site – if you lose or forget the URL for your photos you will have to re-upload them because there is no search feature or user account. CNET suggests you go to Webshots, their main photo site, if you want those destination site features. But for users of Myspace and other social networking sites that just want a place to store photos, AllYouCanUpload is a seriously cool site. If it gets traction (and it will, even if it didn’t have CNET behind it), it will force PhotoBucket and Imageshack to rethink their offerings. And that is great for consumers.</p>, <p>See <a href=""http://martingreen.typepad.com/forward_looking_statement/2006/05/allyoucanupload.html"">Martin Green’s blog</a> (CNET’s GM of the Communities Group) for an in depth discussion of the product, including CNET’s new back end storage solution called “Haystack”.</p>, <p><strong>A final note:</strong> we are seeing more and more new web applications that keep piling on new features to the point where it’s nearly impossible to understand what they are doing. When I see something like this – a service that strives to do one thing efficiently and without friction, it makes my heart warm. Simple does not equal boring. Simple can be disruptive. I want more services like AllYouCanUpload.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/upload570.gif""/></p>]"

The Snapstream Mini costs $2000 ($6000 less than the original Snapstream Server) and offers most of the capabilities of the more expensive product. One of the main differentiators is memory capacity; the Mini offers a little over 1000 hours of recordable content whereas the server product allows 2300 hours of recordings.</p>, <p>The Snapstream Enterprise products are a cross between a powerful DVR and a search engine. The Snapstream allows enterprises to record thousands of hours of TV (from both satellite and digital cable sources) and search inside the recordings for keywords such as a company or individual’s name. The interface looks and feels like a consumer DVR so it’s pretty easy to use. The product allow multiple users to schedule and search inside recording via a laptop, desktop or through the TV itself. Users can record several shows at once (the Mini allows 2 shows simultaneously, the Server allows up to 10 shows to be recorded at the same time) and have email alerts sent to users when a search item is mentioned. The products also allows users to trim and clip the records, email a clip url and burn recording onto a DVD.</p>, <p>This is undoubtedly an incredibly useful tool. Enterprises from a diverse set of  sectors have already been using the Snapstream Server. For example, <a href=""http://enterpriseblog.snapstream.com/2008/10/snapstream-tv-search-in-the-world-of-politics/"">Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign</a> used the Snapstream to monitor the media’s coverage of her and her campaign. The E! channel’s “The Soup” uses the product to find relevant clips and content for the show. Emerson College’s Communications program uses the product for educations purposes.</p>, <p>A hybrid of digital media and old media, the Mini now offers businesses a pretty powerful media capability at a fraction of the price. And with the current state of the economy, this product has definite potential.</p>, <p><img src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ss3.png""/><br/>

Redfin To Change the Rules of Real Estate Sales,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/redfin""><img class=""shot2"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/redfinlogo.gif"" style=""float:right;""/></a>Seattle based <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/redfin"">Redfin</a> is making two major announcements today.</p>, <p>First, they’ve closed an $8 million Series B round of financing, from Vulcan Capital, BEV Capital and Madrona Venture Group. This follows a (roughly) <a href=""http://www.redfin.com/stingray/do/news-exec"">$1m Series A</a> round in January 2006. New CEO Glenn Kelman, the founder of Plumtree, joined the company in September 2005.</p>, <p>Second, Redfin is expanding their service out of the Seattle area to include the bay area in California (and will be expanding to Los Angeles, San Diego and nationwide soon).</p>, <p>They have an intruiging and aggressive business model. Instead of providing useful real estate information to consumers and then pointing them to real estate professionals like competitors <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/30/real-estate-vertical-search-with-trulia/"">Trulia</a> and <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/04/13/zillow-goes-3d/"">Zillow</a>, Redfin is doing their best to completely remove real estate agents and brokers from at least half of a home sale.</p>, <p><img class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/redfin275.gif"" style=""float:left;""/>Redfin combines MLS listing information (homes for sale) with historical sales data (homes already sold) into a single map. If you find a home you like and want to place an offer, Redfin will represent you in the buying process (they have a call center with licensed real estate professioinals to guide you). Here’s the good part: They reimburse you 2/3 of the buy-side real estate fee directly on closing. <strong>The average amount reimbursed to the buyer is $11,402 </strong>(and that is based on relatively low Seattle home prices).</p>, <p>Redfin is also testing a seller-representation model, called “Direct for Sellers”, that will handle all aspects of a sale for a flat fee (currently $1,350). On a $500,000 home sale, this saves the seller $13,650.</p>, <p>Everything isn’t rosy for Redfin, though. They’ve been operating in Seattle for a number of years and have numerous war stories to tell about threats, stalkings and other disturbing behavior towards their employees and some customers from, apparently, angry real estate professionals. Hopefully things won’t get out of hand as they continue to disrupt this stubbornly inefficient market.</p>, <p>I haven’t met the Redfin team yet, but am looking forward to <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/05/25/techcrunch-seattle-party-next-week/"">seeing them tonight at the TechCrunch Seattle party</a> that I am co-producing with them, <a href=""http://www.farecast.com"">Farecast</a> and <a href=""http://www.triphub.com"">Triphub</a>.</p>, <p>Screenshot (showing $106,000 refund on a $5.3 million San Francisco house):</p>, <p><img class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/redfin560.gif""/></p>]"

HSPA will also benefit from technology ‘leap’ subscribers in the developing nations, and handset churn elsewhere, with users migrating to HSPA-based broadband as the norm.”</p>, <p>The study added that Mobile WiMAX will likely see single digital percent proportion of the global mobile broadband subscriber base by 2012, but could likely see substantial growth afterward.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.juniperresearch.com/index.php"">Juniper Research</a></p>]"

The new engine should put those jokes to rest. And the company is taking the product and the launch very seriously – Ask.com CEO Jim Lanzone walked me through the product personally earlier this week.</p>, <p>The search engine has two separate user interfaces. It can be found on the <a href=""http://www.ask.com"">Ask.com</a> home page (link to blog search on the right sidebar) as well as <a href=""http://www.bloglines.com"">Bloglines</a>. The underlying engine is the same, although the interface and functionality is slightly different on the two sites.</p>, <p><strong>Ask.com Blog Search</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>Searches can be conducted by “posts”, “feeds” or “news”. The news option conducts a search from 7,000 pre-approved blog and news sites to reduce noise.</p>, <p>Results can be narrowed to a specific period of time (anytime, last hour, last week, etc) and can be sorted by relevance, date or popularity. “Popularity” is determined based on the their “ExpertRank” algorithm and several sources of Bloglines data, such as subscriber count, links, citations, etc. A blog with more links and more subscribers on Bloglines will have more relevance than other blogs. “Relevance” factors in both popularity and freshness to give meaningful recent results.</p>, <p>There are a number of other features worth noting. Feeds related to the query are listed on the right sidebar, along with RSS information for subscriptions. Each search result contains additional options as well: a binoculars graphic (scroll over for popup with last five posts from result), “Save” (save result to a clipboard), Subscribe (to a feed reader) and Post To (Digg, Delicous, Newsvine etc.).</p>, <p>Advanced search features are accessed via an javascript drop down menu at the top of the screen.</p>, <p><strong>Bloglines Blog Search</strong></p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>Bloglines is using the same back end search engine as Ask.com, although the interface and feature set has notable differences. A key feature is a “+” button next to each result. Click on the button and the full post is presented with original formatting (not quite the original formatting actually, but pretty close).</p>, <p>Another difference – each result has a “more info” link that shows the number of bloglines subscribers  for that blog and any citations for that post.<br/>
<strong><br/>
My Thoughts on Relevance:</strong></p>, <p>There is a big need for the equivalent of Google Page Rank for blog search relevance. Link analysis on a post just doesn’t work – the content is too fresh to develop meaningful link analysis results. There are now three experiments going on with relevance: Technorati bases relevance solely on “authority” of the blog, which is calculated solely on unique inbound links to the blog itself. This works much of the time, but can break quite easily. TechCrunch, for example, can be the highest rated blog on just about whatever I write about, regardless of whether I know anything about it. If I write a blog post on a political issue, for example, it will appear at the top of results even though I have no qualifications for doing so. Bloglines is taking a different approach, by factoring in a number of statistics such as Bloglines subscribers, link analysis and other information. This may eliminate or reduce the non-topic-specific Technorati authority problem. <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/05/01/new-blog-search-engine-sphere-launches/#comments"">Sphere</a> is making an effort to assign real authority to a blog on a given topic. They look at links in and out, as well as a semantic analysis of the blog itself. Theoretically, on Sphere a blog that is relevant in one area won’t be relevant in another. It’s a good theory and may work over time in practice as well. But the blog search relevance battle is far from over, and I look forward to new experiments over time.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/ask560.gif""/></p>]"

MediaFLO is the cellphone chip and cell infrastructure-maker’s solution for mobile TV.

But this spectrum is regulated by the FCC and is meant for (very) old-school analog TV.</p>, <p>The solution Qualcomm came up with is sneaky and smart, was to buy licenses all over america on the same UHF frequency (UHF channel 55), and use that frequency for the digital, mobile TV MediaFLO puts out.

But now, regular Internet users will have an easy way to upload videos and create their own video blog channel on Yahoo Video.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>The only limit on uploads is file size – each file cannot be larger than 100 MB – but there are no time, bandwidth or total storage limitations. Videos can be set to public or private, and viewers can search and sort videos by popularity, category (pre-defined by Yahoo) or tags (user created). Like YouTube, videos can be rated by viewers, commented on, embedded into other websites, etc.</p>, <p>The biggest benefit to using Yahoo over other competitors may be the potential for exposure. Popular user generated videos will be periodically featured in a number of places on the <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/05/16/yahoo-launches-new-home-page/"">new Yahoo home page</a> when it launches.</p>, <p>And unlike YouTube and other video sites, Yahoo is not going entirely with Flash.

Dyson Root 6 Puts Its Root Down,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">&lt;img src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/IMG_3460.jpg"" class=""center""<br/>
I'm going to write this thing up in a bit more detail when I have a mess to clean up – Blake is spending the week here for tonight's event, so I'll clean up his wood shavings when he leaves – but here's a quick look at the Dyson Root 6, the only handheld vacuum that doesn't lose suction and looks like a Doom weapon.<br/>

The device is quite sturdy and large, much bigger and beefier than a Dust Buster or other similar devices. In terms of sucking, boy does it suck. We were able to grab big hunks of dirt outside as well as flour in the kitchen. It comes with a long nozzle attachment along with a little brush attachment, a recharger, and a battery.</p>, <p>Interestingly enough, the Root 6’s motor is so powerful that the vacuum begins to shift when you turn it on, making you feel like it might go out of control and suck up your pets. We haven’t completely dirtied it up yet, so we haven’t tested the suction claim, but if its anything like <a href=""http://www.dyson.com/the-ball/default.asp?sinavtype=menu"">the Ball</a> we have now, we’ll be pretty impressed.</p>, <p>Now i have the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Root-Down-Beastie-Boys/dp/B000002TXO"">Beastie Boys</a> in my head.</p>, <p><img class=""center"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/IMG_3463.jpg""/><br/>

But In-Stat’s recent study “Road Warriors 2007: Love Them or Lose Them” actually has some bad news for wireless operators. High average revenue per user (ARPU) customers in North America are unhappy with their service, but is that really a surprise? Over 60% of customers however feel unappreciated, and 80% think providers need to do more.</p>, <p>“The kind of appreciation these users would like to see include loyalty programs where subscribers earn points for awards, free or low-cost directory assistance, and free batteries and travel chargers,” says Bill Hughes, In-Stat analyst. “The good news for operators is that these three awards could be turned into even more revenue. For example, directory assistance directly encourages more calling, and offering more batteries and charging options ensures that heavy users can always make a call.”</p>, <p>Wireless operators may want to take Bill’s advice to heart. If the Road Warrior gets too unhappy some wireless operators may be forced to act in Mel Gibson’s next movie.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.instat.com"">In-Stat</a></p>]"

Phillips Brings Ambient to Video Games,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/>There is nothing worse than playing a video game and having no peripheral stimulation. Sure, you’ve got the big TV, you’re playing Halo, you get the Wraith, but everything surrounding your 42″ flat panel is distracting the hell out of you. There is no remedy.</p>, <p>But Philips has an idea. It’s taken that “ambient backlit flat TV” thing up a notch with its amBX system. These lights, which you spread around your “gaming environment”, are meant to match the ambient lighting of your video game, so you’re “in” the game. In addition, they have fans, to simulte the air rushing by your soldier’s head as he runs through a field.</p>, <p>Really.</p>, <p>We’re not sure when this will debut or how much it will cost, but it’s about a useless as a movie script at Ben Affleck’s house, and if it’s remotely as popular as their TVs with the same concept, look for us to rush out and buy this never.<br/>

And though their launch timing could not have been more unfortunate, there is a lot about this Australia-focused blog search engine to like.</p>, <p>Gnoos is focused on indexing Australian blogs as well as bloggers with a “global voice”. Because of the different focus it’s hard to compare the result set for a given query to other blog search engines. I’m focusing on the feature set instead, and in that respect Gnoos is at the top.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>Each results (a blog post) can be commented on at Gnoos, and rated. Total votes up and down for a post are counted and, soon, will be used to determine relevance in later searches. Clicking on the “more” button pulls up the entire post. This seems like an obvious feature and some of the other new blog search engines have it, but Technorati continues to leave this out, forcing a click through to the blog to read the entire post. Finally, and I like this feature best, tags can be added to a post on the fly in a box below the summary – and although tags aren’t useful right now, Ben tells me that they will be building functionality around tags soon.</p>, <p>Beyond the features, there’s just something that feels good about the Gnoos site.

We Want Wii: Preorder Demand Higher Than Expected,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/>The reports are coming in, most Gamestops and EB Games stores were overwhelmed with larger crowds for the Nintendo Wii than they were earlier this week with the Playstation 3.

Free Fred Wilson,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""bars"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-1700"" height=""316"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/bars.jpg"" title=""bars"" width=""324""/>Fred Wilson finds himself on two sides of the fundamental issue of our time: the user’s right to access data the way he or she wants to. On one side, that of the user, Wilson is an investor and board member of Boxee, a startup that translates web pages into a form more easily consumable on a TV screen. One site in particular, Hulu, just <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2009/02/18/content-owners-force-hulu-to-kill-boxee-support/"">shut Boxee down </a>at the insistence of the content providers for material on the NBC and Fox-owned site.</p>, <p>Boxee’s popular because it leverages Hulu’s free access to mainstream content in an on-demand solution. It’s the long-awaited rollup of TV or the computer, where on demand entertainment can be watched on the big screen under computer control. The studios don’t want us getting used to that methodology, especially not when it breaks out of the tightly controlled box where you can watch for free (ad-supported) or pay (DVD and Pay per view on demand) but not free on demand on the big screen.</p>, <p>The main reason for this is the one users mentioned in the Hulu comments, namely that the Boxee/Hulu combination encouraged users to quit using satellite and cable services and their DVRs and time shift off the Net instead. It’s a variant of the reason Apple doesn’t open up AppleTV to direct recording and playing of studio content so as to protect the pay to download iTunes service.</p>, <p>Fred <a href=""http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/02/the-valentines-day-breakup.html"">suggests</a> users don’t understand the distinction between watching via Safari or Firefox and via Boxee. That may be true, but we certainly do understand it probably has to do with the studios protecting the networks and the set manufacturers just like they did when they all stonewalled DVRs until enough competition developed between satellite and cable to trigger the dissemination of free recorders to encourage switching.</p>, <p>The other side of the Where’s My Data Home version game that Fred is involved in is Twitter, where he has a similar investment and board role. Twitter has spent much of the last month or so rate limiting its third party developers, degrading their user experiences and in some cases, killing the add-ons outright. While it’s hard to tell whether the blame lies with outages like this week’s slowdown of Twitter messages moving to FriendFeed (near real time to 30 minutes at last word), the net effect is to raise questions about the viability of the satellite service.</p>, <p>FriendFeed aggregates many different activity and news streams, but Twitter produces the lion’s share of traffic to and from the smaller site. None of this would be noteworthy except that Twitter has been anything but open about how and with whom they will share “their” data. The history of Twitter’s removal of Track, acquisition of Summize search services, and recent <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2009/02/18/twitter-moving-to-make-real-time-search-more-central/"">surfacing</a> of packaged search terms suggests the long awaited business model is tied to controlling the data pipeline, much as the studios control theirs in the case of Hulu, Boxee, iTunes et al.</p>, <p>Wilson commends Hulu for being open and transparent and “allowing the community to discuss and debate this decision out in the open” on the Hulu blog. He’s right about Boxee and should take his own advice to heart and encourage Twitter to do the same about user’s concerns on its site. “Open and transparent” is the first step forward to a time when users can use third party sites such as FriendFeed without fear that they will be cut off from living in the new converged media reality. Right now even Facebook looks more responsive to user concerns than Twitter.</p>]"

Thus the two companies compliment each other in these areas.</p>, <p>Alvarion’s expertise in base station WiMAX and broadband wireless systems will combine with Hitachi Com’s mobile gateway, construction and maintenance experience.  Hitachi Com is developing ASN-GW, which will increase the speed and efficiency of traffic flow.  Alvarion is developing smaller and more efficient base stations. These will use 30% less power and weigh 50% less.</p>, <p>If smaller, faster and more fuel-efficient wireless systems can be built in Japan, we may see them here in North America.  I seem to remember something in history about smaller and more fuel-efficient cars…</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.hitachi.com/"">Hitachi</a><br/>

"Rojo Has Blog Search, Too","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.rojo.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>After writing about new blog search engines from <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/05/31/askcombloglines-launch-blog-search/"">Bloglines</a> and <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/06/02/the-other-blog-search-engine-that-launched-yesterday/"">Gnoos</a> this week, Chris Alden (Rojo CEO) pointed out to me that <a href=""http://www.rojo.com"">Rojo</a> also quietly launched a blog search service earlier in the month. Rojo has <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/tag/Rojo/"">focused on</a> building out its feed reader in the past – this is its first real dive into blog search.</p>, <p>It looks like it went nearly undetected: there are no comments or trackbacks to the Rojo <a href=""http://blog.rojo.com/rojoblog/2006/05/new_rojo_search.html"">blog post</a> announcing the product (although <a href=""http://libraryclips.blogsome.com/2006/05/19/rojo-search-and-rojo-memedigger/"">Library Clips</a> caught it).

This is an algorithm approach to relevance, similar to what Sphere and Bloglines have done (although with very different data points). And it seems to work – relevance is very good.</p>, <p>Rojo is trading off quality with depth of the index. Unlike Technorati, Rojo is indexing just a couple of million blogs. Whether a blog is in the index is based on, first, subscribers from its feed reader product (if someone subscribes to a blog, it’s automatically in the index) and second, additional blogs that they’ve determined to be of high quality, through a spidering process.</p>, <p>Results are presented along with a voting and tagging feature, and the “+” symbol can be clicked to see the full blog post.</p>, <p>This is just a first pass at search.

Something I Don't Get About Swaptree,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.swaptree.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>The model behind new startup <a href=""http://www.swaptree.com"">Swaptree</a>, which will launch later this summer, is to allow people to trade media – books, music, dvds and videogames – directly with other users. As <a href=""http://reviews.cnet.com/4531-10921_7-6537194.html?tag=blog"">Rafe Needleman</a> notes, here are other services out there that offer this – <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/07/lalalalalalaanother-way-to-share-music/"">lala.com</a> for music and <a href=""http://www.peerflix.com"">peerflix</a> for dvds. But those sites are specific to music (Lala) or DVDs (peerflix), and both charge users a small fee per transaction.</p>, <p>Swaptree will be different. First of all, any media can be swapped for any other kind of media. So I can trade the book I just finished for a DVD, or whatever. And Swaptree isn’t charging transaction fees. The site will support itself from page views. Users are responsible for their own shipping charges, however.</p>, <p>Swaptree is making it as easy as possible to conduct trades. To trade an item, all you have to do is enter the UPC or ISBN code on the back of the media and Swaptree fills in the details. And once you find someone to trade with, Swaptree will allow you to print out postage and shipping information right on the site.</p>, <p>Swaptree presents a compelling case for trading on their site, too. They say all you have to do is enter the item you want to trade, and you’ll be presented with “thousands” of items you can receive in trade. Their algorithm will also set up trades with up to 4 people, increasing the likelihood that you’ll see something you like.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/><strong>So all that’s great, but something doesn’t smell right to me at Swaptree.</strong> First of all, trying to make a living on pageviews and advertisements will be tough. Lala and Peerflix don’t seem to be generating <a href=""http://www.alexaholic.com/peerflix.com+lala.com?y=p&amp;r=1y&amp;z=1"">enough page views</a> to support a company on advertising. I can see how Swaptree could be much more popular than either of those sites, but it may not be enough. Mitigating this, however, is the fact that their customer base will be primed for high end advertising – these people will obviously be ready to click over to Amazon and buy something on the spot.</p>, <p>But that leads me to my second, greater concern. Entering in an item and being presented with thousands of swap choices sounds great. I’m sure I could find things that I’d like to trade. But just how is that demand curve for my item generated? It seems to me that at some point in the process, I’m going to be asked what I am willing to trade for that item (if no one does this, there’s no way to create a market). And if I have to decide what I want and wait for that item to come on the market (assuming, with a stretch, that the person will want what I have to offer), well, it’s probably easier to just sell it on eBay and pick up whatever it is I’m looking for while I’m there. So what I see happening is that lots of people may be willing to enter their stuff in for trades, I don’t think that many people will take the time to say what they want to trade it <em>for</em>.</p>, <p>Maybe this is just a long winded way of saying that money does serve quite a nice purpose in our society, and eBay seems to have perfected the swapping market using that long proven currency of trade.</p>, <p>Sign up for the Swaptree beta on their <a href=""http://www.swaptree.com"">home page</a>.</p>]"

The new product, <a href=""http://www.nooz.com"">Nooz</a>, will leverage technologies developed by Rojo but will not be under the Rojo brand.</p>, <p>When I spoke to Rojo CEO Chris Alden about Nooz, he stressed that it is designed specifically for the Myspace crowd, whereas Rojo is aimed at the geek/early adopter crowd.</p>, <p>There are three key features. First, Myspace users can set up an account at Nooz and link directly to their Myspace profile. At Nooz, users can review blog and other RSS feed news items by category and rate them (this leverages the <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/16/rojo-gets-relevant/"">Rojo Mojo</a> Digg-Like functionality). The more votes a news item gets, the higher it appears within a particular category. New stories can also be submitted using a bookmark function.</p>, <p>Second, users can view what news items their Myspace friends submitted or voted for.</p>, <p>Third, users can create a Flash widget to include on their Myspace page (or any web page – see widget below) that lists news stories they’ve voted for. Alternatively, the widget can show a pure RSS feed, although clicking on a news item brings up the post in Nooz, not on the original site).</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.nooz.com/static/widget/nooz/noozlist.swf"">http://www.nooz.com/static/widget/nooz/noozlist.swf</a></p>, <p>Myspace has certainly been consulted on the Nooz product, too. <strong>I checked out the <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/rosslevinsohn"">Myspace page of Ross Levinsohn</a>, the President of Fox Interactive (parent company to Myspace) and he has a Nooz widget displayed prominently on his page.</strong> This may or may not be an endorsement of Nooz – but it certainly indicates that the Fox team knows about the product and is testing it out. And I note that Ross doesn’t have any other third party widgets on his site.</p>, <p>A bevy of Myspace focused third party widgets have launched recently (see <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/06/02/tagworld-widgets-platform/"">Tagworld Widgets</a> and <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/05/24/my-pick-list-adds-myspace-widget/"">MyPickList</a>, for example). I don’t see these services as a sign of over-infatuation with Myspace, but simply a realization that, with nearly 80 million members, Myspace is an entire economy unto itself. Companies are going to find a way to participate in that economy as deeply as possible, with ever-more-tailored products.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/nooz565.gif""/></p>]"

"GlowSkin, The Skin That Glows","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/><br/>
Electroluminescent (EL) lighting technology is not new. It’s been used for some time now in the dashboard displays of automobiles as well as in cell phone screens. However, SafeLites’ GlowSkin uses unique, flexible EL lamps and can be made to any size or shape. The EL lamps are activated using special electronics, an inverter to control voltage and frequency and a power source, which the company says is usually a battery. Also, the lamps are washable, so you can put them into all types of clothing–everything from vests to wear during road work to snowboarding jackets.</p>, <p>
There are a number of industrial ways this stuff can be used because it doesn’t impair night vision, it can be seen at great distances and through smoke, fog or snow and they don’t generate heat or require much power. But we’re looking forward to GlowSkin showing up in consumer products since it can be used to illuminate the wires of earbuds, cases for portable electronic devices like MP3 players or gaming systems and parts of gaming peripherals such headsets, controllers and keyboards.</p>, <p>
EDIT: Reporter Matt Hickey says if he saw someone walking down the street with a glowing shirt, say an annoying club kid, he’d have to punch them in the head just on principle.</p>, <p>

This category is probably the most relevant for product trading if you consider the life cycle of a product (quite short) and the high prices of new hot games. Teenagers cannot usually buy a new game every 3 months but they really want to play many new games.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/split_catalogue_s.jpg""/></p>, <p><strong>On SplitGames you declare what you have but most importantly what you want</strong>. They will guarantee the transaction and match traders in a safe and simple way. Each game has a value in points based on retailpricing, date of release, and supply and demand of the game on the site. Each time you trade a game you accumulate points you can use to acquire a new game. The mechanics is simple and clear. They’ve bypassed Swaptree’s algorithmic approach for a pure marketplace.</p>, <p>SplitGames is not free. But on the other side they guarantee a trading system that works and that enables you to avoid bad surprises (on delivery, choice of games, secure transaction, etc.). Of course this model is also good for the company because success of service will drive directly success of revenues.</p>, <p>But most importantly SplitGames manages to build a <strong>true vertical community on gaming</strong>. Each game has his forum and can be rated and commented. This creates a dynamics that will serve well the company in eventually achieving its ultimate goal: generate game trading.</p>, <p>To conclude, Swaptree’s approach is general, algorithmic and advertising based. SplitGames is vertical, premium and community driven. In my view the second approach has better chances to win not only because of its business model but mainly because users will feel they are part of a community where they can receive what they want and trade what they don’t want.</p>, <p>Let’s hope SplitGames will be soon available in English.</p>]"
Kozoru searches in your favorite sites by IM,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.byoms.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>Kansas based <a href=""http://www.kozoru.com/"">Kozoru</a> launched a new service today called <a href=""http://www.byoms.com/"">BYOMS</a>, or build your own mobile search.  It’s a handy way to search inside preselected sites by IM on a desktop or mobile device.  Think <a href=""http://www.rollyo.com/"">Rollyo</a> mashed up with AIM.  Though not the easiest thing in the world to figure out at first, it could be a real time saver once you’ve got it set up.</p>, <p>Kozoru is a two year old company founded by John S. Flowers, a highly controversial figure who calls himself a Silicon Valley ex-patriot. When I say controversial, I mean for example that his bio page in Wikipedia has been marked as disputed and locked from editing. Flowers also has some fans, see the video testimonial on the BYOMS site from David Warthen, co-founder of Ask.com.  But Flowers is a software guy and the proof is in the pudding, isn’t it?</p>, <p>How does it work?  It took me awhile to figure it out exactly, but now that I have I see that it doesn’t have to be difficult at all.  Users start an account at <a href=""http://www.byoms.com/"">Byoms.com</a>, then make a list of related web sites they would like to be able to search from IM.  You can set up a search client for one site or for several together. Quite a few preferences can be changed; number of replies sought, length of the URL displayed in the results, number of sentences to display from immediately before and after the search terms, etc.</p>, <p>The best way to see how the system works is to try it out.  It’s AIM only, unfortunately, but if you’ve got an AIM account here’s three query clients you can add to your buddies list.</p>, <p>The SearchTechCrunch buddy will search TechCrunch.com, Crunchnotes and MobileCrunch all at once.  Give these a spin, you might just decide to keep them in your buddies list for good.</p>, <p>It looks like it’s far more efficient than visiting any of these sites just to search inside them.   It’s also better than using a regular search engine using the site: operative.  It’s faster and there is a lot more control available, for the search builder at least.  Even if there were absolutely no other strong points here, I would find it useful to be able to search inside multiple sites with one fast query.</p>, <p>There are two key steps you’ll want to remember when creating your own byoms.  First, you have to create an AIM client for each search and provide its screen name and login to Kozoru so the system can catch your queries.  Second, you have to select “publish” not just to expose your search client to others, but to use it yourself as well. Kozoru’s Justin Gardner says he believes that this is where the real excitement will come in – when content publishers start seeing<br/>
subscriptions to searches of their sites via BYOMS.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/byoms565.gif""/></p>, <p>There are a few down sides here as well. It’s not a lot of fun to go to AIM.com and create a new screen name for every search client you want to produce. There doesn’t appear to be any way to keep your search clients private.  You can’t put phrases in quotes, but you can use a minus sign to exclude terms.  Sometimes if the site you’re searching has a lot of comments indexed, it’s difficult to tell whether your results were written by the site’s author or a commenter without clicking through a link.  I don’t think any of those are deal breakers, though.  The system is flexible and fast enough that I think it has a lot of potential.</p>, <p>Business model?  No word yet, beyond being bought out.  Flowers says the company has not received any traditional VC funding, but was reported to be in acquisition talks with Google for some period of time. If I get 4 lines of text each for 2 search results, for example, I personally wouldn’t mind getting a few words of contextual advertising clearly marked.</p>, <p>Once the search clients are set up, they couldn’t be easier to use.  I know I plan on setting up several for groups of sites I search inside often.  Will other people do so?  I think that IM is friendly enough and this service is unobtrusive enough that it’s quite likely they will.  I’d say the controversial Mr. Flowers came through on this one.</p>]"
Age Verification Problem for Content on the Go,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""porn.jpg"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/porn.jpg""/>Porn is extremely powerful. Some hate it; others can’t get enough of it. It is also one of the factors that made DVD the success story that it is today. Porn is among one of the reasons why VHS beat out BetaMax. But pornography is also something many people don’t want to see in their neighborhoods or around their kids. On TV it is easy enough to “lock out” those channels, and there are software to block Web sites. So what’s the problem with mobile phones? Basically the problem is that mobile content providers might not be able to easily verify the age of users.</p>, <p>Today it isn’t uncommon for teens, tweens and even the occasional post-toddler to have a mobile phone. According to Jupiter Research adult content on mobile devices could be worth about $3.3 billion (that’s billion with a B) by 2011. That’s a lot of green made from seeing a bit of flesh. This will be an issue that we’re sure will be watched closely.</p>, <p><a href=""http://multichannel.com/article/CA6465560.html?industryid=47286"">[Via Multichannel News]</a></p>]"

Vivee Adds Dimension to Talking E-mail,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""vivee.jpg"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/vivee.jpg""/>As we reported earlier this week, <a href=""http://mobilecrunch.com/2007/08/07/drunk-drivers-perceived-as-dangerous-as-text-drivers/"">texting while driving is almost as bad as drunk driving</a>. And we’ve also been hearing about a lot of solutions to the problem. Maybe waiting until get to where you going to send or read an e-mail is the best option, but who are we to tell people to be a little more patient! Besides, no one would listen to us anyway. They’re too busy talking on the phone or reading their SMS! In fact some of the numbers are alarming. A recent survey by Nationwide Insurance found that one in five people text while driving, and that number jumps to one in three among 18-34 year olds!</p>, <p>But one solution we’ve heard about this week as well is Vivee, or Voice Interactive Voice Enhanced Email. This is a new service from USTelematics, Inc., which reads your e-mail or text to you. A animated avatar character appears on the screen and appears to speak the incoming message to you.</p>, <p>“Safety should be our primary concern when driving,” says Charlene Montalbano, Product Manager of USTelematics, Inc.  “Insurance studies show that distracted drivers cause 80% of all traffic crashes, so several states already have laws banning the use of handheld cell phones while driving.  Now, lawmakers are becoming more precise and targeted in the approach to eliminating driver distractions for drivers by considering laws that specifically ban text messaging and reading email while driving.  Vivee will not only keep your focus safely on the road, ultimately, ‘she’ may help you avoid a ticket.”</p>, <p>Vivee connects to the Internet through the Verizon Wireless EVDO high speed network, and when you get an incoming e-mail or text, the Vivee alerts you so that you can listen to your messages. Why it needs the talking avatar we can’t say. Wasn’t the idea to get you to STOP LOOKING AT A DEVICE? Still any product or solution that does get people to avoid texting while driving is a good thing… let’s just hope that users won’t feel the need to watch their Vivee avatar and then feel the need to respond.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.ustelematics.com/site/html/vivee-talking-email.html"">US Telematics</a></p>]"

All four major carriers – Cingular, T-Mobile, Verizon and Sprint – are driving a hard bargain.</p>, <p>One method of deployment possible is with Cingular, offering their 680 for <b>free</b>, but forcing the customer to sign up for a $30 internet plan. What’s the catch? The customer can’t change or remove that $30 internet plan for the entire 2-year contract period. Doing so would incur the wrath of Cingular in the form of fees and a dog going over to chew on your tender areas. If you do the math, $30 for two years makes you…taking the integral…$720 poorer.</p>, <p>Of course this is just a possible launch plan. Another could be a partner with T-Mobile to offer the same thing. Except T-Mobile really wants Palm to cough up a Treo with WiFi so T-Mobile can sell their hotspot plans.</p>]"

Andreessen in realtime,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""andreessen"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-1721"" height=""288"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/andreessen.jpg"" title=""andreessen"" width=""314""/>At a time when many people are saying innovation is dead along with the economy as we knew it, I can’t help but feel the hot breath of a surge in the power of the network. As Marc Andreessen reminds in his <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2009/02/20/andreessen-on-charlie-rose-i-am-creating-a-fund-full-video/"">fascinating conversation with Charlie Rose</a>, the Internet didn’t take off until the browser. The infrastructure was in place for some time already, but when the browser appeared, the TV generation sat up and took notice.</p>, <p>Now we’re at the threshold of the realtime moment, and history seems to be repeating itself. For some of us, the advent of a reasonably realtime message bus over public networks has changed something about the existing infrastructure in ways that are not yet important to a broad section of Internet dwellers. The numbers are adding up — 175 million Facebook users, tens of thousands of instant Twitter followers, constant texting and video chats among the teenage crowd — a semi-secret economy of interactive media that is sucking the chewy chocolate center out of the one-way broadcast sector.</p>, <p>The standard attack on realtime is that it is the new crack. We’re all addicted to our devices, to the flow of alerts, messages, and bite-sized information chunks. We no longer have time for blog posts, refreshing our Twitter streams for pointers to what our friends think is important. It’s the revenge of the short attention span brought on by 30-second television ads — the myth of multi-tasking spread across a sea of factoids that Nick Carr fears will destroy scholarship and ultimately thinking.</p>, <p>Of course this is true and also completely irrelevant. My daughter told her mother today that her boyfriend was spending too much time on IM and video-chat, and not enough on getting his homework done. She actually said these words: “I told him you have to get away from the computer sometimes, turn it off, give yourself time to think.” This is the same daughter who will give up anything – makeup, TV, food — just as long as I don’t take her computer or iPhone away.</p>, <p>So realtime is the new crack, and even the naivest of our culture realizes it can eat our brains. But does that mean we will stop moving faster and faster? No. Does that mean we will give up our blackberries when we become president? No. Then what will happen to us?</p>, <p>The browser brought us an explosion of Web pages, produced first by professionals, then by small business owners, and finally, with blogs, by anybody. The struggle became one of time and location; RSS and search to the rescue. The time from idea to publish to consumption approached realtime.</p>, <p>The devices then took charge, widening the amount of time to consume the impossible flow. The Blackberry expanded work to all hours. The iPhone blurred the distinction between work and play. Twitter blurred personal and public into a single stream of updates. Facebook blurred real and virtual friendships. That’s where we are now.</p>, <p>Realtime has to be managed. The first tools in any transformative period are hard coded to the sensibilities of the radicals, the pioneers on the front lines. Scoble may appear ridiculous in his zeal for the extremes of the social media envelope, but his calculation is much more conservative than you might think at first glance. By opening himself to the tyranny of the crowd, he connects with that reality we each face.</p>, <p>The difference between 150 friends in our address book and 5,000 in Facebook is vanishingly small: we don’t have time for either. Trying to capture the nuances of friendship in a social media context is no more difficult than in high school, or easier. This is our life’s work, learning how to balance our needs with those of those we care about.</p>, <p>Once we reach a certain point in the shift, the tools begin to be more malleable as technologists surrender some control in search of viral spread. Bookmarks in the early browsers led to del.icio.us, Yahoo’s index to Digg, banner ads to page rank. The two-way quality of the network encouraged the viral spread of sharing.</p>, <p>Swallowed as we are in this vortex of change, it’s hard to see where the tools are going. Realtime has to draw on the human elements to ease the transition, harness the power, quiet the fear. The anger about Twitter mania, the reluctance to delve into the civil rights aspects of the quarantining of our data, the fratricide going on between bloggers and journalists — all these are symptoms of the power of this struggle for our minds.</p>, <p>Andreessen is one good reason why we’ll work our way through this. He talks impossibly fast, probably only a small fraction of the speed at which he thinks. Listening to him is an exciting and sometimes daunting experience, like listening to The Dark SIde of the Moon at 78 rpm.</p>, <p>Charlie Rose:<br/>
So to play offense for a newspaper for you means what?</p>, <p>Marc Andreessen:<br/>
Oh, you got to kill the print edition.</p>, <p>Charlie Rose:<br/>
You would stop the presses tomorrow?</p>, <p>Marc Andreessen:<br/>

You talk to any smart investor who controls any amount of money, he will tell you that the game is up. Like it’s completely over. And so the investors have completely written off the print operations. There is no value in these stock prices attributable to print anymore at all. It’s gone.</p>, <p>Charlie Rose:<br/>
So you would recommend to the owners of the New York Times, stop printing papers.</p>, <p>Marc Andreessen:<br/>
Yeah, absolutely. You have to. You have to –</p>, <p>Charlie Rose:<br/>
And take your losses –</p>, <p>Marc Andreessen:<br/>
Yeah. You have to.</p>, <p>Charlie Rose:<br/>

In fact, Google is getting out of hand.</p>, <p>After I <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/06/06/google-spreadsheets-almost-launches/"">wrote</a> about the launch of Google Spreadsheets this morning, one commenter <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/06/06/google-spreadsheets-almost-launches/#comment-65039"">said</a> <em>“Its very nice and sleak. Will be very useful for keeping track of money etc”</em>, as if this was the first spreadsheet he’d ever seen. Some of the other comments were also overly effusive. Thankfully, another commenter <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/06/06/google-spreadsheets-almost-launches/#comment-65079"">noted</a> that, in fact, the product isn’t exactly new: <em>“spreadsheets have been around about as long as computers”</em>. I agree – while Google released a very nice Ajax spreadsheet today, they didn’t exactly change the world.</p>, <p>Now we are ending the day with a post by Philipp Lenssen at <a href=""http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2006-06-07-n12.html"">Google Blogoscoped</a> – one of his readers noticed that Picasa, which Google acquired in mid-2004, will soon be adding albums (yes, albums) to their suite of photo products. Philipp describes Picasa thusly: <em>“Picasa is Google’s desktop photo management software – something like Yahoo’s Flickr, except it’s not on the web.”</em> Yeah, it’s just like Flickr, except without tagging, sharing, commenting and, of course, it isn’t a web service.</p>, <p>Ryan at Cybernet is impressed, <a href=""http://tech.cybernetnews.com/2006/06/06/watch-out-flickr-google-is-coming/"">saying</a> <em>“[Google has] so many services that they could integrate with a photo service…so that people can create their own sites and add their photo albums. Oh the possibilities!”</em> (Note: I like and read both of these blogs, so I’m just picking on the posts, not the blogs in general).</p>, <p>What drives this kind of blind enthusiasm? When is the last time Google released a product that really changed our lives? For me, it was (and is) their core search engine. I grant that Google Maps pushed the envelope and forced the other big Internet guys to improve their own offerings (but today Microsoft and Yahoo are both significantly better than Google). And I do appreciate the POP access to Gmail (this was the one thing that converted me from hotmail for personal email). Everything since has been, well, somewhat underwhelming.</p>, <p>Now, if Google actually announces their intention to eat Microsoft’s lunch by trying to kill their Office revenue with a full online office suite, that would be interesting. Or if they said they wanted to eat into Flickr’s growing market share by competing more aggresively in online photos, I’d have some respect for them. At least we’d have something to talk about besides online photo albums and all this <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/06/its-nice-to-share.html"">blathering on</a> about how important sharing is. This isn’t about corporate secrecy – we all know that Google is trying to hit Microsoft where it hurts. It’s about deniability if things don’t work out as planned. One thing Google hates more than anything is to look stupid. They are afraid to fail.</p>, <p>Google needs to embrace the possibility of failure. They need to stop making all of the same mistakes Microsoft made. They need to build aggressive and visionary products, kill stuff that doesn’t work, muzzle their <a href=""http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/06/03.html#a1461"">out-of-control</a> communications team and start telling us what Google 2.0 is going to be.</p>, <p>See different rants today from <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2006/06/06/is-google-wasting-its-genius-cycles/"">Om Malik</a> (<em>“Is Google Wasting Its Genius Cycles?”</em>) and <a href=""http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2006/06/05/googles_new_web.html"">Paul Kedrosky</a> (<em>“Google is beginning to bug me”</em>).</p>]"

Vigor Monsoon II Lowers CPU Temps Without All The Liquid-Cooling Tubes,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/><br/>
While Intel and AMD might be doing more to lower the operating temperatures of their processors, overclocking them still causes some high temps, especially if the case is chockfull of other performance components. This generally causes builders and buyers to switch to effiecient-yet-costly liquid-cooling systems. Vigor Gaming, a small gaming PC vendor, has been investing in another solution, though: the Monsoon Active TEC CPU Cooling System. Here’s Vigor’s explaination on how it works:</p>, <p>
The thermoelectric cooler (TEC), or Peltier Cooler, is a solid-state heat pump that uses the Peltier effect to move heat. The modern commercial TEC consists of a number of p- and n- type semiconductor couples connected electrically in series and thermally in parallel. These couples are sandwiched between two thermally conductive and electrically insulated substrates. The heat’s pumping direction can be changed by altering the polarity of the charging DC current.
</p>, <p>Did you get all that? Well, just know that it’s an efficient way to cool an overclocked processor without the headaches or expense of setting up a liquid-cooling system inside your PC. At least it is according to a review on ExtremeTech. The site says while the first version was less than impressive, the second-generation pulls off dropping the temperature as promised. Albeit, at the cost of $149 and some above-average fan noise.</p>, <p>

The polyphonic ringtone was a workhorse of the mobile industry, and much like SMS was developed despite the fact that it was never really needed.</p>, <p>However, polyphonic ringtone managed to make great headway. It was the first time that a mass-market industry was created for selling music directly to individual customers nearly independently of major record labels. More importantly it took advantage of the technology of the era, including MIDI-like file sizes, and finally polyphonic ringtones gave work to musicians would probably would have otherwise been reduced to playing in wedding bands.</p>, <p>We don’t know what will take the place of polyphonic ringtone entirely. Already it has many (illegitimate) children in the form of MP3 ringtones, ringbacks and other annoying audible cues. Polyphonic ringtone will be missed by some.

When Zooomr sees photos being uploaded within a time window that are similarly geotagged, it assumes an event is occuring and groups those photos accordingly.

Folding@Home Works 20x Faster On a GPU Than CPU?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/> we looked at earlier to run the Folding@Home software, you’ll get 20 to 40 times the output compared to a CPU. That’s a mighty bold claim, one that Techreport discovered wasn’t quite as it seemed.</p>, <p>Although Stanford claims the beta GPU client runs 20 and 40 times faster on new Radeons, and although Radeons have many gigaflops of processing power, the current client doesn’t quite report this tremendous workload. In the test, the GPU client had 2640 work points completed whereas the CPU client only had 899. That’s far removed from the 20~40x reported. What gives?</p>, <p>Well actually, the discrepancy comes from the fact taht points and work units are on a different scale depending on whether you’re using CPUs or GPUs. The GPU client is actually doing 20 to 40 times more work, but because the benchmark is set so much higher, the result is that the points are, give or take, not all that much different. So since the scoring scheme doesn’t reflect the bigger workload done, don’t expect to show off your Folding@Home scores to your nerd buddies and brag about how much more cancer research you’re doing.

It’s strange, but it sounds like it works and people might really like it.  There’s no indication yet whether or when this could be available as a service.</p>, <p>
Google Research team members Michele Covell and Shumeet Baluja along with Michael Fink of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem’s Center for Neural Computation were given the best paper award for their report on the system at the the <a>Euro ITV </a>(interactive television) conference last week. (<a href=""http://www.mangolassi.org/covell/pubs/euroITV-2006.pdf"">“Social- and Interactive-Television Applications Based on Real-Time Ambient-Audio Identification”</a> 10 pg PDF, see also the <a href=""http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/06/interactive-tv-conference-and-best.html#links"">Google Research blog post</a> on the paper.)

The system compresses the captured audio into <em>irreversible</em> (emphasis theirs) summary statistics which are then compared to a database of mass media statistics and used to determine what the browser should display.   Possible service offerings discussed in the paper fall into four categories:</p>, <p>
The system requires no dedicated television-connected hardware, protects users’ privacy and is technically feasible, the researchers report.  Experiments with a laptop placed in the lap of a person ten feet from a television and engaged in loud conversation with some one next to them were successful in providing matching online content – when channel surfing was taken into account.
</p>, <p>
Lest you fear that all broadcast TV is a huge data-set, the report says that ff the database of summaries holds only 32-bit descriptors of 5 second clips, then up to one year of broadcast information could be held in less than 1 GB.  The researchers report that this is made much more feasible by re-runs.

Privacy concerns were addressed in the prototype by compressing captured audio on the user’s computer before transmitting summary data to the database for comparison and by offering a mute button in the program.

Most of the new online spreadsheets applications allow various levels of viewing and editing a single version of a spreadsheet, which is stored on a server instead of locally.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>But wikiCalc is a much more significant, if less flashy, piece of software than Google Spreadsheets, particularly now that it is being paired with SocialText’s development and enterprise sales resources.

Upcoming versions of Office will have similar sharing functionality as wikiCalc, but at significantly higher price points. And wikiCalc, like all wikis, will have a true audit trail built in – every change to every cell is stored and can be rolled back. It’s like an infinite undo button.</p>, <p>Socialtext’s wikiCalc software will be released under an open source license for installation directly onto servers.

OnAir GT Mobile HDTV Receiver,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/><br/>
It might not be the first notebook accessory you reach for, but the OnAir GT mobile HDTV receiver is certainly one of the coolest, letting you watch high-definition and analog over-the-air and digital (QAM) and analog cable television broadcasts on your laptop. Distributed by <a href=""http://www.autumnwave.com/"">Autumnwave</a> in the States, this little black box draws its power via USB cable and delivers video through an included A/V adapter cable, quickly turning your system into a TV with full DVR capabilities complete with EPG.

Umundo makes mobile photo and video sharing easy,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://umundo.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a><a href=""http://umundo.com"">Umundo</a> is a new service that allows users to share photos and video captured on mobile phones without the need to set up an account.  By entering a phone number or email, anyone can subscribe to a feed in a number of online readers or in iTunes.  Code is also available to display video on MySpace pages.</p>, <p>Oliver over at <a href=""http://mobilecrunch.com/2006/06/08/umundo-launches-mobile-video-capture-and-embedding-application/"">MobileCrunch wrote a positive review of Umundo</a> last night and compares it to another system called <a href=""http://abazab.com"">Abazab</a>, but I have some concerns about Umundo myself.</p>, <p>The system is very easy to use and seems unique in its support for uploading both photos and video by phone.  Unfortunately the ease of use comes at a serious cost in functionality.</p>, <p>Since there are no accounts required there’s no option to remove single images or videos from your feed.  The entire feed can be deleted at once, but in the fast paced world of embarrassing social blunders and inappropriate teenage behavior that MySpace covers it seems important to have the option of deleting a single photo. If there was a simple account page <em>available</em> this and other issues could be easily solved.</p>, <p>Widespread adoption is also likely to be mitigated by the fact that you can’t view photos in iTunes or MySpace.  According to the FAQ only video is supported in those systems.  There are certainly ways to offer code to display images in a feed directly on an HTML page.  Given how widespread iTunes use is it would make sense to me to offer images as album art. The system is interesting because it offers both photo and video support, but the photo support seems like it was an afterthought.  That’s too bad, as I can imagine photos could be integrated better with MySpace and this could get a lot of use.</p>, <p>Feed subscriptions are displayed as “Clip(s) from 2134453567 headlines” in your feed reader and items are title links.  A title field for the feed itself would be a logical thing to include.  I’m not sure how compelling most MyYahoo users, for example, would find a box on their page with a string of numbers above a list of one line text links.</p>, <p>Hexlet LLC, the company behind Umundo also owns <a href=""http://rssbazaar.com"">RSSBazaar</a>, a feed publishing service used to deliver content like Umundo images and video.  I imagine this means that the company is capable of making some changes to the feed delivery details.</p>, <p>Umundo may become a desirable tool if better functionality develops, but for now I think the ease of use comes at too high a cost.<br/>

Mobile Simplifies Marketing in South Africa,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""south_africa_flag.jpg"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/south_africa_flag.jpg""/>The speed of which a mobile marketing campaign can be created and rolled out has made it the preferred method to reach the target audience in South Africa. Unlike print, radio or even television, which all day time to roll out a campaign, mobile ads are being done in days and loaded onto a mobile marketing platform for distribution. While this is true of any part of the world, it is notable that this is being the most popular way to reach the audience in South Africa.</p>, <p>Traditional mediums can take weeks or even months, but MMS-based ads are reaching more than 90 percent of the base with 48 hours of the campaign being rolled out. And once again this has to do with the fact that for decades many people didn’t have traditional landlines, and with the price of mobile handsets coming down it is a device nearly everyone is acquiring. In South Africa there are 36 million active SIM cards, which is more than TV viewers, radio listeners or Internet users. Thus companies are looking to reach out to mobile users with marketing campaigns as it is the largest group of users in the country.</p>, <p>What we find interesting to note is that for decades people without landline phones, TVs or radios were still considered viable consumers but most marketers couldn’t reach them. Now thanks to mobile handsets more and more people are suddenly becoming an audience for advertising!</p>, <p><a href=""http://allafrica.com/stories/200708130441.html"">[Via All Africa]</a></p>]"

Sony had them on display at last week’s Digital Life show, and while they certainly had the good looks we expect from Sony, the reps didn’t exactly let us set one up and test it.</p>, <p>
Sony did, however, send the LF-B20 over to CNET’s John Falcone to put through its paces. The verdict:</p>, <p>As of this writing, we feel the Slingbox still delivers a better overall experience, thanks to a more streamlined setup process, superior software and streaming performance, and better device compatibility. But there’s still a lot to like about the LF-B20: the built-in wireless, the lineup of supported devices (Windows PCs, PSPs, Macs), the remote control customization, and the sub-$250 price point. It’s certainly a big improvement over the earlier LocationFree TV products, and there’s no reason that it can’t get better still with continued software and firmware upgrades.</p>, <p>The setup process was apparently a big sticking point as was the $29 charge for additional clients to use on other devices. Having setup a SlingBox, we can attest to just how easy everything comes together and the SlingPlayer client can be installed on multiple systems. But, if you’ve got a PSP and like that “Sony Style” maybe the frustrations of installation are worth it.</p>, <p>

Are Mobile Games a Threat?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""darth-mobile.jpg"" class=""right"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/darth-mobile.jpg""/>Will mobile games open your handset to the dark side?

That’s the good news. Now for the bad – Microsoft isn’t providing any kind of driver for the HD DVD drive, so you won’t be able to watch those HD DVDs on your PC. Since the HD DVD drive is manufactured by Toshiba, I’m guessing (along with everyone else), that some third party software developer will come up with an unofficial driver for it anyway, if enough people get their hands on the HD DVD drive.

The service is being provided by MONILINK, which is a joint venture between VocaLINK and Monitise plc.

This new format, dubbed The Mobile Mixtape, will feature exclusive tracks that are delivered straight to mobile devices.</p>, <p>“If I have a hot mixtape, it’ll sell out,” says DJ Envy. “A new album will be hot only for a few weeks, then die down. That’s what the kids want.”</p>, <p>Content provider Cellfish Media will distribute the seven-track compilations mixed by DJ Envy, and provide them as ringtones and full-track downloads to mobile consumers. Subscribers to the service can pay a per-download fee, or buy tracks in a discounted package. Additionally they will get seven new ringtones each month, along with daily insider tips about the latest happenings with the stars of hip-hop, as well as exclusive celebrity interviews and video blogs.</p>, <p>“Yesterday, kids would have to wait for a mixtape to be pressed up and distributed; today, they have to run home to their computers and search for it; tomorrow, the instant something is blowing up, it shows up in your pocket.

Samsung D900 aka Black Carbon Hands On,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""center"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/IMG_3526.jpg""/></p>, <p><img/> is another Ultra model – the D900 is an extremely slim slider with 3-megapixel camera and a unique UI designed in conjunction with Adobe. The Samsung folks didn’t mention a timeframe, but it should be hitting our shores very soon for about $350-400.<br/>
<span id=""more-1770""></span><br/>
<img class=""left"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/IMG_3527.jpg""/>Like the Trace, the D900 is extremely thin and designed with high-speed Internet and some unique features including uGo, which changes the background image to a local landmark depending on your roaming country (it works better in Europe, obviously) and uTrace which discreetly sends you an SMS if someone ganks your phone and puts in their own SIM card. This model is GSM-only and is unlocked.</p>, <p><img class=""center"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/IMG_3530.jpg""/></p>, <p>The UI is extremely interesting for one small reason. The menus have “pop-up” sections, so when you select something, a little window appears allowing you to drill down without leaving the original screen. This saves a few clicks and is considerably more friendly than the standard “deck of cards” UI which requires you to pop back and forth between two separate menus. Too better understand the difference, imagine submenus in Windows or OS X under the main menu options. The general feel is more elegant and less cluttered.<br/>
<img class=""center"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/IMG_3521.jpg""/><br/>
The packaging follows Nokia’s lead in creating a full, exclusive package as opposed to generic box. This is definitely a status phone, although a lack of shiny materials might work to its disadvantage. It will also come in multiple colors including red and silver.<br/>
<img class=""center"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/IMG_3523.jpg""/><br/>
This is an interesting move for Samsung, paralleling with Nokia’s flagship store model involving direct phone sales to consumers and by passing the carriers almost entirely. If there’s one thing you feel here in SK it’s that we’re seriously behind the curve in terms of cell features and handsets. Luckily, moves like this will bring us a little closer to the 21st century.</p>]"

One True Media gets funding for easy online slide show creation,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://onetruemedia.com""><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/onetruemedialogo.jpg"" style=""float:right;""/></a><a href=""http://onetruemedia.com"">One True Media</a> will announce today $5 million in new funding from <a href=""http://www.kpcb.com/"">Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers</a>. The service provides online video and photo slide show editing and sharing.</p>, <p>One True Media’s service is highly usable, is well positioned to target families and online social network users but leans towards lock-in in its approach to the tension between the viral nature of online multimedia and it’s business interests.  This tension is caused by the company’s business model, which aims to monetize data storage and the creation of hard-copy artifacts like DVDs and photo books.  Given the company’s target demographics, difficulty exporting files to other systems or sharing without the creation of a simple account may not be a serious threat to the growth of the service.</p>, <p>This is exactly the kind of high-quality system that could make web based multimedia editing and sharing a mainstream activity.  It may not make the “data wants to be free” crowd happy, but it could show that Web 2.0 is for more than just geeks.<br/>
<span id=""more-1772""></span></p>, <p><strong>History</strong></p>, <p>Formed in February 2005 and launched in December of the same year, <a href=""http://onetruemedia.com"">One True Media</a> is headed by CEO Mark Moore and co-founder John Love.  Moore is trained as a computer scientist, began his career at Oracle and has founded three previous startups.  Love has an MBA and a background as an IT executive.  Mark Fletcher, head of Bloglines until last week, is an angel investor and advisory board member.</p>, <p>This week’s announcement that <a href=""http://www.kpcb.com/"">Kleiner Perkins</a> is investing in the company means that One True Media joins a portfolio that includes WebMD, the women’s online community iVillage, Audible, Amazon.com, Google and more than 450 other companies.  Founded in 1972, the Kleiner Perkins team includes Bill Joy, William R. Hearst III and many other notable figures. Kleiner Perkins partner Randy Komisar, a former CEO of LucasArts Entertainment, has joined the One True Media board.</p>, <p><strong>Usability</strong></p>, <p>The strongest part of One True Media is the system’s usability.  The flash uploader and drop down menus for selecting everything from clip duration to transitions are likely to provide just the right amount of creative control for the service’s target customers.  The zoom-to-crop and simple pan functions might seem corny, but when it’s baby pictures or high school memories set to Coldplay on MySpace – that’s ok. One Coldplay song is available, along other 50 other songs by default and users can upload any Mp3 file for the soundtrack.  The audio mixing function lets users drop the music or video sound to relative degrees, clip by clip, in case someone says something important in between guitar riffs.</p>, <p><strong>Business Model</strong></p>, <p>One True Media is focused on helping users create slide shows they will want to purchase on DVD (1 for $25, price lowered with quantity), turn into a printed book ($30 for first 20 pages) or store long-term online ($4/month).  Premium subscription allows captioning, unlimited upload, 20 GB storage, personalized video players, up to 5,000 views per month  and access to their files in MP4 format.  Unpaid accounts can store files for 60 days.  The company also offers video and photo scanning and restoration services.</p>, <p>Access to a user’s files is limited to either premium subscription or purchase on a DVD.  So if you were hoping to give One True Media a try for free , take what you created and leave the system with it – you are unable to do so.  This may be acceptable to many parents and MySpace users.</p>, <p>More difficult is the requirement that an account be created before a non-registered user is shown the code to embed a video in another site.  Of course a page’s source can be viewed and the code needed is right there, but the ease of access provided by YouTube, for example is not there. Using the “email this slide show” link also requires registering for an account. Anyone can view a slide show without an account.</p>, <p>Nonetheless, the company says it is seeking to harness the viral spread of online multimedia.  If this happens, it won’t look like the Web 2.0 darlings to date in photo and video sharing.  One True Media is a different kind of business and is clearly taking many steps to get users registered.  More than 330 thousand users registered in the first six months the service was online.</p>, <p><strong>Partnerships</strong></p>, <p>Behind extreme usability, One True Media’s partnerships with other online services is going to be the biggest factor in its future.  The two biggest partnerships to date are with <a href=""http://typepad.com"">TypePad</a> to offer a video player widget for bloggers and with Johnson and Johnson’s <a href=""http://babycenter.com"">BabyCenter.com</a>.  One of BabyCenter’s features is a bulletin board with prominent links to One True Media’s co-branded BabyCenter video page.</p>, <p>The company will be dedicating significant resources to developing and increasing capacity for similar partnerships as key to their growth strategy.</p>, <p>I was very impressed with the usability and high-profile partnerships of One True Media.  I like the subscription business model.  Presumably, though, the company is hoping that a large number of people will buy DVDs or photo books. I imagine that most people comfortable today with manipulating photos and video online are not going to pay to have their slide shows burned to DVDs.  This service is easy enough to use, though, that it may be adopted by far more people who are interested in purchasing such services.</p>, <p>If more partnerships are formed with large, nontechnical online communities then the people who discover the service will find a strong system for making a compelling slide show.  They may be just the kinds of people who will pay for such a service, despite current trends of free multimedia services online. That seems likely, and the future looks good for the partnership between Kleiner Perkins and One True Media.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/onetruemediascreen.jpg""/></p>]"

Each post can then be ended with keywords that will determine which Amazon products appear beside it.  Keywords are inserted using something like the following: “bk_keywords:canon camera, apple ipod.”  Couldn’t be much simpler.  While MyPicklist has partnered with far more affiliate programs, it appears to rely on users tagging particular items of interest to them on other affiliate sites.</p>, <p>Most important may be the revenue sharing model.  While MyPicklist is reported to give users “approximately” 40% of affiliate revenue generated and does not offer this detail prominently on its website, BloggerKit proudly says it’s using your affiliate ID 85% of the time.  BloggerKit is not as flashy looking as MyPicklist, but if it is targeting an increasingly sophisticated group of young users then I think that will be ok.</p>]"
Touchscreen iPod: The Saga Continues,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/><br/>
I’m really starting to hate all the Apple product guessing that goes on these days. Here is a familiar old favorite, the infamous touchscreen iPod, which is apparently definitely (for reals, yo – Blake) due for release in December of this year. This tidbit comes courtesy of Trusted Reviews (can’t argue with a site with “trusted” in its name) saying it talked to an unnamed person at “a multinational company that develops iPod products and which sport ‘Made For iPod’ accreditation and the info flowed after I questioned the value of one of his company’s new iPod accessories.” This person let slip that a 6G iPod with a touchscreen filling an entire side of the device was on its way to stores by year’s end.</p>, <p>
While TR probably did hear what it claims to have heard, I’m calling bullshit on this one. I’ve spoken to a number of multinational “Made for iPod” accessory vendors and Apple has kept them all in the dark about any new products. Also, a December launch makes no sense. It’s too late in the holiday shopping season, unless we’re talking December 1.

"Plugaid will bring trackbacks to MySpace, Xanga","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.plugaid.com""><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/plugaidlogo.jpg"" style=""float:left;""/></a> <a href=""http://plugaid.com"">Plugaid </a> is an innovative and easy way for bloggers using systems that don’t support automatic trackback discovery to show the conversations that their posts are a part of.  The tool targets systems like MySpace, Xanga and Blogger.com.  I think it will be very welcome there.</p>, <p>Plugaid was co-founded by a student from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology named Trent Kang.  It’s currently in Alpha mode, collecting emails for interested future users.  The creators have started a conversation that can be participated in for testing, as I’ve done at the bottom of this post.</p>, <p>It uses embeded flash to display participating blog posts discussing a particular post, with drop down excerpts and links to the full posts.  The photo of each linking blogger is also displayed if available.  Users must provide nothing more than a password that can be used to remove the link from the display if they wish to do so later.</p>, <p>In the sample below, I’ve clicked “participate,” entered a password and got a few lines of code to include in my post.  That signifies that I’m participating in the conversation about the Plugaid demo, and other people who are participating as well should see a link to this post in their Plugaid box shortly.  The links that appear can display full excerpts when you click the “more” button, where you’ll also see the linking URL and a button to visit that blog post.  Right now the excerpts are all very short because there are just a few people writing very short test posts.</p>, <p>One downside may be that participation in a plugaid discussion doesn’t appear to provide a direct link in HTML to other posts in the conversation and thus doesn’t help with link love.  I imagine this is not a big concern to many likely users, though.</p>, <p>The language used by Plugaid is a little unclear, as well, and could use some clarification.</p>, <p>It’s a simple tool, with no clear business model yet, but I think it could really catch on.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.plugaid.com/socket.swf?sid=1000004&amp;cid=1000027"">http://www.plugaid.com/socket.swf?sid=1000004&amp;cid=1000027</a><img src=""http://www.plugaid.com/1000004/1000027""/></p>]"

The new service will combine RSS feeds of news, photos, videos, events and places with Google Maps and Google Earth. Content will be mapped from Reuters, Flickr, Eventful, YouTube and other users’ maps. Updates to locations of your choice will also be available for subscription.</p>, <p>Platial is one of a number of services that allow users to easily create their own maps on top of Google’s API, but it’s notable for its rapid adoption and financial backing.  The company says that Platial hosted 200,000 place maps in 300 cities in its first 5 months since launch.  See, for example, <a href=""http://www.platial.com/system/map/1711"">Public Biofuel Stations</a> (surprisingly, all East Coast US) or this guy’s <a href=""http://www.platial.com/paiges/map/1535"">Hopeless Romantic Map</a>, chronicling a world’s worth of personal heartbreak, apparently over one woman.</p>, <p>The company’s backers include Kleiner Perkins, Omidyar Network, Tim O’Reilly and Clay Shirky.</p>, <p>Platial’s newest service makes sophisticated, if logical use of RSS feeds from a wide variety of sources.  Leveraging so many syndicated multimedia sources could position Platial well in a field that includes competitors such as <a href=""http://wayfaring.com"">Wayfaring</a>, <a href=""http://communitywalk.com"">CommunityWalk<a></a>, </a><a href=""http://frappr.com"">Frappr</a> and others.  Each of these services has a unique feature set, but display of multimedia and news from off site is particularly compelling.</p>, <p>That will be even more true if users are able in the future to layer selected feeds over their own created maps or make some other creative integration of this new offering with the basic Platial service.  The Today Nearby service seems to act primarily as a secondary offering beyond map creation; it will be used for monitoring place-based multimedia, events and maps made by Platial users who are concerned with the same locations you are.<br/>

"Flock Raises New Venture Round, Launches Public Beta","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.flock.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>It’s been nearly eight months since Silicon Valley based <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/10/20/flock-is-launching-publicly-today/"">Flock released a developer version</a> of its Firefox based browser. This evening they are releasing their first public beta version, available for Windows, Mac and Linux machines, at <a href=""http://www.flock.com"">Flock.com</a>. I’ve been running the most recent developer release on my Mac for the last few weeks and it is now my browser of choice.</p>, <p>I interviewed the Flock founders – Bart Decrem, Geoffrey Arone and Anthony Young – as well as investor Jason Pressman from Shasta Ventures, last night. The podcast of the discussion is up on TalkCrunch, <a href=""http://www.talkcrunch.com/2006/06/13/episode-9-flock-launches-an-interview-with-the-founders/"">here</a>.</p>, <p>Flock is a Mozilla based browser (see also <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/02/07/songbird-to-launch-tonight/"">Songbird</a>, another application built on the Mozilla code base). They’ve built additional features to the core Firefox code base that make the browsing experience more seamless, including photo integration with Flickr or photobucket, social bookmarking integration with Del.icio.us or Shadows, a blogging tool, enhanced search and a RSS reader.</p>, <p><big><strong>Photos</strong></big></p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/flockphotos565.jpg""/></p>, <p>Photos stored in either Flickr or Photobucket are integrated directly into the browser experience, scrolled horizontally just above the browser window. Photos can be uploaded to these accounts by dragging them into the browser. Or, photos can be added to any web page that accepts html (a comment area on a blog, for example) by dragging the photo directly into the web page. This is the single most compelling reason (for me) that I’ve switched to using Flock – to bring my Flickr photos to the desktop.</p>, <p>Photobucket and Flickr are currently supported. More photo services will be integrated over time (I’ve suggested that CNET’s <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/05/29/cnets-allyoucanupload-is-disruptive/"">AllYouCanUpload</a> be supported as well, for example).</p>, <p><big><strong>Bookmarking</strong></big></p>, <p>Flock also has close integration with Del.icio.us and Shadows social bookmarking accounts. Clicking on the star button next to the address bar bookmarks the current page, and metadata such as tags can also be added. More bookmarking sites will be supported over time.</p>, <p><big><strong>Blogging, Search, RSS</strong></big></p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Flock has an integrated blogging tool, with integrated tagging, that works with most major blogging platforms. Users can switch between preview and html views. Search via the top right drop down (same location as Firefox) is set to Yahoo as a default, and an be changed to Google, Technorati, Wink, etc. (no support for MSN or Live.com search though). Beginning to type in a search query brings up a pop up box that shows recent bookmarked sites, visited sites and search results from the default search engine.</p>, <p>The integrated RSS reader is excellent (image above to left). Any visited web page with a feed shows the orange feed icon in the address bar. Clicking on it shows a preview of the feed. Another click and you are subscribed. Within the reader feeds can be read individually, or in “river of news” fashion.</p>, <p>Flock will make the majority of their revenue from the search bar, just as Firefox does. They have a revenue share agreement with search providers for searches completed through the browser. The low end estimates I’ve heard suggest that Firefox generates at least $2-3 per year per user. Flock is also going to charge service providers to integrate directly into the browser, and plans on launching co-branded browsers with partners to increase distribution. Given their close relationship with Yahoo (search, del.icio.us and flickr integration), I wouldn’t be surprised to see a Yahoo version of Flock distributed sometime this year.</p>, <p>Flock has also raised a new round of financing led by <a href=""http://www.shastaventures.com"">Shasta Ventures</a>, rumored to be in the $10 million range. Previous investors included Bessemer Venture Partners and Catamount Ventures.</p>]"

There will be an initial 14 new titles, which will debut throughout August and September, and will be made available online in an iPhone-compatible format.</p>, <p>“Reaching consumers on mobile devices and the Internet is increasingly important for publishers,” said Brian Murray, president of HarperCollins Publishers Worldwide. “Our digital warehouse gives us the unique opportunity to quickly offer access to our titles on the newest technology, and we encourage people to provide feedback about their experiences.”</p>, <p>There is catch; there is always a catch. This “Browse Inside” application allows consumers to sample pages of the HarperCollins titles online. iPhone users can view the first 10 pages of chapters one and two of the 14 books, and users can buy or pre-order the book from a list of retailers. So far no go on the whole book option.</p>, <p>It seems to us at MobileCrunch that offering a sample doesn’t really do the reader, or would be reader enough of a service.

Working with Evevoy, we believe 2shop4 will provide shoppers with a truly unique shopping experience.”</p>, <p>OK, so don’t plan on boycotting the mall just yet. 2shop4 will be launched in the U.K. in October and there are plans to bring the service globally in 2008.

Six men are currently under incitement under this law.</p>, <p>Other countries should consider following Ireland’s lead in this. Prisoners lose certain civil rights while incarcerated, one of which is an expectation of privacy. Mobile phones make it difficult for prison officials to monitor an inmate’s outside communications.

Giants like Apple and Google started as great ideas that were backed by little capital, but grew into huge successes. A young company, Textango, may have found a market with huge possibilities.</p>, <p>Textango is a mobile billing and music delivery platform that lets customers purchase music by sending a premium text message on their mobile phone. The music download is charged to the customer’s mobile phone bill, making credit cards unnecessary.</p>, <p>In the Untied States, many young people have a mobile phone. (One source claims 80% of 12-18 year olds in the U.S. have mobile phones.) But they don’t have credit cards which allow them to download music legally. Textango allows those of us without plastic to enjoy our music, while compensating the artists for their work.</p>, <p>Musicians are paid 50% of the retail for each purchase.  Textango keeps 4% and the rest goes to the mobile phone provider. Most credit cards charge a fee of around 4% for each transaction, so Textango is charging a reasonable fee.</p>, <p>Because Textango is trying to break into the market, its number of artists is limited.  I counted around 630 albums. This limits the consumer base. But Textango allows artist to signup for the service, so new musicians can make their songs available to the public without having to go through a record label.</p>, <p>Some parents may see Textango as a bad thing.  They have control (or should) over a child’s credit card use, but paying for music through the phone bill is one way a child can get something the parents don’t want to pay for.

The Future Of Innovation Could Reside in Collaboration,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">Yesterday, I attended the <a href=""http://churchillclub.org/"">Churchill Club</a>‘s program addressing “The Innovation Economy: R&amp;D and a Crisis.” The panelists included <a href=""http://www.almaden.ibm.com/almaden/labdir/"">Josephine Chang</a>, an IBM Fellow and Vice President of IBM Almaden Research Center; renowned innovation expert and former Cisco CTO <a href=""http://www.theinnovationgap.com/judy-estrin-bio"">Judy Estrin</a>; <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/rick/"">Rick Rashid</a>, a senior vice president of research at Microsoft; VC executive <a href=""http://www.mdv.com/team_bio.html?id=25"">Sue Siegel</a>, a partner at Mohr Davidow Ventures; and journalist and economist Michael Mandel, of BusinessWeek (he was the moderator).</p>, <p>It’s impossible for anyone to have a serious conversation about how technology and innovation will change in the future without addressing the current state of the economy and how enterprises, entrepreneurs and big businesses will be able to overcome this immense obstacle. The consensus among the panel was that innovation tends to drive economic growth and Mandel posed several questions about the future of innovation in the current recession. Judy Estrin, a widely known expert on innovation and the author of “<a href=""http://www.theinnovationgap.com/"">Closing the Innovation Gap</a>,” made some pretty interesting observations and predictions.</p>, <p>Estrin believes that there is a definite innovation deficit at the  moment due to a past culture of developing short-sighted technologies instead of technologies that plant seeds for the future. In order to get to sustainable growth, she said that innovation needs to focus on progress for the long-term vision.</p>, <p>Estrin added that for healthy innovation to occur, small business, government, non-profits and entrepreneurs need to collaborate. Estrin also brought up an interesting point about the nature of of future innovation. She explained that the future of innovation remains in the intersection of technologies and individual sectors, citing the potential of combining health care and data storage technology as an example. Innovation and technology need to move away from the “silo” model, and head towards a collaborative and multi-platform model, according to Estrin.  But changing the model towards interdisciplinary innovation will be incredibly challenging, she maintained.</p>, <p>Estrin brings up a good point about the necessity for the U.S. government to be a part of helping foster innovation in the current economy. It should be fascinating to see the exact nature of the government’s plan to implement policies towards jump starting innovation (let’s hope there are plans) and whether it will involve Estrin’s collaboration thoughts. The administration has yet to name its CTO (Vivek Kundra was nominated as the White House’s CIO today), but I’m assuming that he or she will have a solid plan on how to combat the “deficit” in innovation in an economic downturn.</p>]"

If you own an Xbox 360, you already know that the 20GB HD you received with the premium console (or bought separately) wasn’t even a full 20GB. The new HD is really something Microsoft should have included with the Xbox 360 when it first launched, not something we have to dish out more money for later. It’s peripherals like this, and the HD DVD drive that really justify the price of the Playstation 3.</p>, <p>When you really think about it, the PS3 is actually cheaper. The only difference is that with one console you have to pay all the cash up front, and the other you don’t. The 100GB HD will be due out in March 2007 (no pricing was announced), and hopefully without the 100GB written over the top.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.gameinside.co.kr/bbs/read.html?table=bbs_newest&amp;page=1&amp;num=196&amp;no=337&amp;d%20epth=0"">Microsoft Announces 100GB HD</a> [game inside]</p>]"

Verizon Wireless G'zOne Type-V Likes It Rough,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/><br/>
Now this looks like some good competition for Sprint Nextel/Motorola. Verizon Wireless’ G’zOne Type-V, the product of a partnership with IP-based, end-to-end networking solutions vendor UTStarcom, combines Verizon’s typical consumer offerings (2-megapixel camera, V-Cast support, VZ Navigator, mobile Web and full messaging options) in a ruggedized clam-shell phone that meets “multiple Military Standards including exposure to temperatures in excess of 140 degrees F, extreme vibration, solar radiation, conditions set to simulate storm conditions of two inches of rainfall per hour with high winds and submersion in one meter of water.” But thankfully it doesn’t look too bulky; the dimensions are 4.1 x 2.0 x 1.1 inches (HWD).</p>, <p>
What does seem to be missing from the phone is push-to-talk service, which is a shame since this phone looks slightly more stylish than other rugged offerings and certainly has the features to take you from job site to home use. Also, how the hell do you pronounce this thing? Gizz One? G-Zone? Geez One?</p>, <p>
No matter how it’s pronounced it’ll be available online tomorrow on Verizon Wireless’ site for $299.99 with a new two-year customer agreement. </p>, <p>

"AOL-Netscape Launches Massive ""Digg Killer""","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.netscape.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>On Thursday, AOL’s <a href=""http://www.netscape.com"">Netscape </a>property will no longer be <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=167455043&amp;size=o"">just another portal</a> – it’s being converted into a Digg-killer. I was briefed on the new site by Jason Calacanis last week. As of tonight, he owns the Netscape property at AOL. The new site will run at <a href=""http://www.beta.netscape.com/"">beta.netscape.com</a> for now, converting over to the main Netscape.com property soon.</p>, <p>It’s not exactly a Digg clone (home page <a href=""http://flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=167468493&amp;size=o"">screenshot here</a>). Submitted stories are voted on in much the same way, and the more votes a story gets the higher it appears in a category home page or on Netscape.com itself. However, the top few spots in each category and on the home page are determined by an “anchor” – essentially an editor choosing from stories moving up the ranks.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>There are 30 topical channels, from “Art &amp; Design” to “Women”. Eight full time and eleven part time editors will manage the site, determining both the top stories as well as staffing a 24×7 chat room where users can discuss stories in real time.</p>, <p>The fact that AOL is launching the new service under the Netscape brand instead of building out a new property says how serious they are about the space. According to statistics provided by AOL, Netscape serves a whopping 811 million monthly page views – far more than Digg today.</p>, <p>Putting this kind of audience in front of a Digg like service could spell trouble for many sites that ultimately make it to the top of the site. A Digg or Slashdot story can send tens of thousands of visitors to a site in a matter of minutes or hours. With Netscape, this effect could be many times larger – possibly resulting in outages at sites headlining the new service.</p>, <p>There are a number of other notable features of the new Netscape. Story submissions can be tagged by the submitter along for easier search in the future. Every category, user and group of friends has their own RSS feed. Also, category anchors will follow up on many stories and post their own editorial content on those stories (see <a href=""http://flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=167467462&amp;size=o"">screenshot here</a>).</p>]"
Nokia in Trade Dispute with Chip Maker Qualcomm,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""nokia2.JPG"" class=""right"" height=""41"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/nokia2.JPG""/>The world’s largest mobile phone maker, Nokia, has asked the United States to ban imports of chipsets made by Qualcomm Inc., along with phones and other products made with those chipsets. Nokia has told the International Trade Commission that the San Diego based company Qualcomm has not properly compensated Nokia for its technology.</p>, <p>As the mobile phone industry grows and provides more services than Dick Tracy could have imagined, legal disputes over money are more likely to occur. Once lucrative royalties may not look so good to patent holders, as their technology is used to deliver services that a few years ago didn’t exist.</p>, <p>Nokia and Qualcomm had a 2001 licensing agreement that lapsed in April of 2007. According to Paul Sagawa, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, in the past few years Nokia has paid Qualcomm around $100 million a quarter to license its chip technology. Nokia feels that it should pay a lower rate for Qualcomm patents because it has patents that control some of the new technology.</p>, <p>If this type of dispute escalates in the mobile phone industry, we may see all-out-war as patent users and patent holders fight for the lucrative fees that customers worldwide pay for new innovative services and technology. International trade lawyers may be able to rack up hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees, while service remains in limbo. In the end, it’s the consumer who pays for these fights with increased fees for new patent agreements and lawsuits.

The service offers cash back for using its affiliate links on select sites, a referral reward program for getting other users into the service and price tracking alerts by email.</p>, <p>Külist is headed by Don Wolfe of San Clemente, California.  I think it’s a great way to offer value to incentivize use of a particular company’s affiliate links.  I haven’t found any other service that combines all the features that Külist does.  It may not be pretty, but I like the way it works.<br/>
<span id=""more-1826""></span></p>, <p>The service supports price comparisons from item pages in a number of different sites:  Google, Froogle, Yahoo, MSN, Ask, Become, Shopping.com, PriceGrabber, Shopzilla, PriceRunner, Amazon, Buy.com, Bestprices, J&amp;R, and Walmart.</p>, <p>On search results or item pages in any of the above services, you can click on the Külist Prices bookmarklet and see a drop down window at the top of the page showing the price of your item on other sites.  Clicking the vendor link in that box enables you to add the item to a watchlist.  The watchlists offers price tracking and alerts by email.</p>, <p>The affiliate links provided through Külist give you a cut of the revenue generated through their use, at least through the services that allow this to be done.  Unfortunately, Külist says it currently cannot offer cash back from Amazon.com, BestPrices or Walmart.  That’s a shame.  You get 2% cash back from the vendors that are included in this feature.</p>, <p>Similarly, the system offers two easy ways to earn %1 cash back for purchases made by people you’ve referred to the system.  They don’t have to identify you as the person who referred them, which is good.  If you email people about the system (no spamming allowed Külist says!) and add Külist in the Bcc field, the email address of the recipient is added to your list of referred friends.  You can also put your own Külist affiliate link on your blog and people who click through will generate revenue for you as well. (I have not done that here.)  The ways this is implemented are not necessarily transparent, but that’s always an issue with affiliate links.</p>, <p>Külist is more than usable enough now and hopefully implementation will only improve with time.

It has six flashing modes or provides a steady beam or can flash to the beat of the music playing. A little sliding lever will also redirect the two LED beams from the front to the sides.

Participants can use telephone, Skype, Vonage or Yahoo to call in.  The company says that SIP support is coming soon.</p>, <p>Finished podcasts are entered into the TalkShoe podcast directory where users can write reviews and leave comments.

Yahoo Hack Day Today,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>Yahoo has had a a couple of regional “Hack Days”, which are day long events where engineers stop everything they are doing and just build stuff that they think is cool. The idea was first <a href=""http://blog.jot.com/archives/2005/05/09/jotspot-inagural-hackathon/"">popularized by Jot</a> last year, and a number of companies have picked up on the idea as a great way to stoke innovation and creativity in a semi-organized way. The goal? Take something from idea to prototype in 24 hours.</p>, <p>Today at noon, however, Yahoo got serious about Hack Days by <a href=""http://www.chaddickerson.com/blog/2006/06/14/yahoo-hack-day-tomorrow-and-some-of-my-inspirations/"">making it Yahoo-wide</a>. Every Yahoo engineer is invited to participate, and other employees are joining in as well. Anyone with an idea is encouraged to gather a team up and spend a day coding. Tomorrow (Friday) at noon, the hacking stops and everyone will get together to review what’s been built.</p>, <p>The effort is being led out of <a href=""http://www.elatable.com/blog"">Bradley Horowitz’s</a> product strategy group, with <a href=""http://www.chaddickerson.com/blog/"">Chad Dickerson</a> and <a href=""http://www.caterina.net/"">Caterina Fake</a> organizing the event.</p>, <p>I’ll be there to cover the event tomorrow, as will <a href=""http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/"">Jeremy Zawodny</a> and John Markoff of the New York Times.</p>]"

It will be a “visual search engine” – give Riya an image and it will return image results that are similar from across the web. They’ve already begun crawling the web for images, a process that will take many months.</p>, <p>When it’s ready, users will be able to search on an image (the easiest way will be via a browser plugin to search right from the page containing the images). See a rug on ebay that has a pattern you like? See other rugs from across the web containing similar patterns. Riya will make money if the result you click on is from another ecommerce company – Riya pockets the referral fee.</p>, <p>Dating is another (if slightly creepy) use for the new Visual Search engine. See someone’s picture on MySpace that you like? Search on their photo to find single people who look similar and who have profiles up on match.com or other dating sites.

"iPod Turns Five, Competition Still Looking for Killer","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/><br/>
On October 23, 2001, the first Apple iPod was launched and every music-player manufacturer has been trying to play “catch up” ever since. CNET’s News.com has a really nice collection of  iPod-related stories, including a fresh <a href=""http://news.com.com/iPod+at+five+The+little+gadget+that+could/2100-1041_3-6127805.html?tag=nl"">retrospective</a> that suggests the only trouble the player faces right now is from the cell-phone industry, and even that’s not much concern since its partnership with Motorola. That’s just sad to me. </p>, <p>I still remember the day my first-generation iPod showed up on my doorstep. A life-long Apple user and music collector I was, in 2001, still relying on a portable CD player for listening to music on the go. There were no Mac-compatible MP3 players worth my money at that time. But then came my 5GB beauty, and though I still have it and it still works (granted it needed a new battery), I’ve bought two more since then as they got lighter, slimmer and larger in capacity. However, I’m still holding out hope that someone, anyone, will create something better so I never ever again have to read another “iPod Killer?” headline.</p>, <p>

Print on the Go with Cloudprint,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""hp.jpg"" class=""right"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/hp.jpg""/>Have you ever been on the go and needed to print something you left behind? In today’s fast moving world it is easy to forget something as you scurry out the door. Road warriors need not fear anymore, as Hewlett-Packard has come up with an application that allows you to print documents worldwide via your mobile phone. This innovation is called Cloudprint.</p>, <p>Cloudprint is a free service that allows a user to share, store and print documents through a mobile phone interface. Here is how it works: a user “prints”, i.e. sends, documents to Hewlett-Packard servers that are connected to the Internet. Cloudprint assigns the user a document code and then transmits that code to the proper mobile phone so the documents can be printed. To retrieve a document, enter the user’s phone number and document code on the Cloudprint Web site. Any documents are retrieved as a PDF, ready for printing.</p>, <p>All this may sound good, but suppose you are in a strange part of town and don’t have a printer available to you. What then? Cloudprint uses Google Maps to point the way to publicly available printers. Almost any printer, any where in the world, that is a Windows-connected printer allows you to publish your documents. (A Macintosh friendly Cloudprint is under development.)</p>, <p>Why would Hewlett-Packard provide such a great service for free? It seems they are doing this to sell more ink. The company’s printing division profits from this year’s third quarter are up 11% over last year’s third quarter. By embracing a strategy to make printing easier and more accessible, Hewlett-Packard hopes to sell more supplies. Environmentalists may be concerned about an increase in paper use created by Cloudprint:  but old documents can be recycled.</p>, <p>Rumor has it that Hewlett-Packard is soon to announce a partnership with a major retailer. The as yet unnamed retailer will offer a variety of Internet-connected printing services at hundreds of locations around the United States. It shouldn’t be long before this type of service sweeps an ever-increasing mobile globe.</p>, <p><a href=""http://cloudprint.hpl.hp.com/"">CloudPrint</a></p>]"
U-G-L-Y: ago7 UMPC,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/><br/>
Generally, I don’t bash products I haven’t seen in person and haven’t used, but it’s ultra mobile PCs like the ago7 that will kill the already small, fragile UMPC market. Will you look at this thing? It needs to be put out of its misery. The reason I’m on the attack this morning is because I received a press release for the ago7 stating it was a new option for “cell phone users seeking more computing power for mobile online activities but wary of clunky laptops.” Are there people actually <em>wary</em> of laptops?</p>, <p>
For $799 you get a 1GHz VIA CPU, 512MB of memory, 40GB of storage and built-in WiFi and Bluetooth, all running on Windows XP Tablet Edition. I’m fine with all of this. And actually, I’m not offended by the company’s suggestion that you use this UMPC with a Bluetooth phone and a data plan to get Web access from anywhere. What I’m irritated by is that whatever company is responsible for creating the ago7 put absolutely no effort into its appearance. It’s great that you want to give people an afforadable alternative to a ultra-portable notebook, but please don’t put it in a package that can be out-classed by a child’s toy.</p>, <p>

Industrious Kid lets parents watch kids network,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.industriouskid.com""><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/industriouskidlogo1.jpg"" style=""float:right;""/></a>Emeryville, California based <a href=""http://www.industriouskid.com"">Industrious Kid Inc.</a> launched a new social networking service for children today called <a href=""http://imbee.com"">Imbee</a>. The service takes strong measures to keep kids safe.  I was skeptical at first, but after looking at how security is implemented I think it just might work.</p>, <p>The company was started with $6 million in funds from founder Jeanette Symons.  Symons was a co-founder of <a href=""http://ascend.com"">Ascend Communications</a>, which was bought by Lucent for $24 billion in 1999.</p>, <p>Imbee provides all the basic functions of other social networking services, except for chat.  What’s most interesting are the parent controls.  An adult with a credit card is required to create an Imbee account.  That adult can then choose whether new blog posts, comments to and from their child and new friend requests will require parental approval before being passed through to the child’s account.  If moderation isn’t selected,  parents still receive email summaries of their kid’s activities.</p>, <p>One concern that many people have about young people being able to post content online is that today’s foolishness could come back to haunt young people later in life.  Imbee says its pages are behind a firewall and that children’s content is shielded from indexing by search engines.</p>, <p>The site itself has no search function and unsolicited contact is not possible without knowledge of a child’s Imbee username.  All children in the system receive a Imbee wallet full of “business cards” they can  give to friends to share those usernames.</p>, <p>Free accounts at Imbee have limited features and a full feature account costs $4 per month or $40 per year.  That sounds like a very viable price plan given the amount of parental concern there is about children online.</p>, <p>Will kids go for this?  If requiring parental approval slows down the fast exchange of comments and friendships too much, they may not want to.  The company says this will be between parents and their children and they expect that in time it will primarily be new friend requests that most parents require approval of.</p>, <p>If the children who join Imbee are old enough to seek this kind of service but still young enough that any amount of parental control isn’t yet anathema to them – it could be a great system.  On the other hand, controling kids online could be a lost cause and educating about staying safe could be the best option.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/industriouskidscreen.jpg""/></p>]"

There are a number of third party tools available for Flickr users to download all their data to their computers.  That data can then be uploaded into another system.  Competitor Zooomr wants to make transitions like that easy to do, and Flickr apparently doesn’t want them to.</p>, <p>Tate from Zooomr says that the exports are a cost of doing business, that Web 2.0 is where “the roach motel stops” and that Zooomr will always make it easy for their customers to take their data elsewhere.  That’s easy to say when you’re the underdog, but the issue does lead to some questions about data portability and web services.

After you peel away all of the extraneous layers, the core of innovation is five or six people building something they think is cool. And there certainly was a lot of that going on at Yahoo at the end of last week.</p>, <p>I walked into a <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/jzawodn/168872536/"">room full of Yahoo employees</a> patiently waiting their turn to show the project they’d just spent 24 hours building.

Ian and his team (Stacy All, Yiling Chen, Raj Gopal Prased Kantamneni, Tejaswi Kasturi, David Pennock and Daniel Reeves) used the core Buzz project and built a predictive market on top of it that tracks all of the Hack Day projects. Yahoo employees can “buy” and “sell” shares in projects, eventually cashing out if the project is included in a public Yahoo product.

<a href=""http://markaboo.com"">Markaboo</a> is a fantastic new social bookmarking tool developed by Christian Romney and Jean Thomas from a company called <a href=""http://www.onclickdialto.com/"">tglo</a>.  It’s open source and has a great feature set.</p>, <p>I’ve used del.icio.us for my social bookmarking for some time, largely out of habit.  Other social bookmarking tools have features that are very appealing to me, but none have been compelling and usable enough for me to seriously consider leaving del.icio.us – until now.</p>, <p>The bookmarklet to save to Markaboo includes all the basic fields for URL, title, tags and description.  There is a nice option to view all your tags and click those you want to apply.</p>, <p>Users can also enter notes pages and upload files as separate items in their archives; Markaboo is for saving far more than just URLs. One of the best features is that photos and notes can be saved, titled and tagged by mobile phone and email.</p>, <p>Bookmarks and favorites can be imported in a number of different formats. There are simple, unobtrusive google ads on the item pages.  The Markaboo user community is made up of programmers right now, but the system is so easy use that the shared bookmarks will likely diversify quickly.</p>, <p>Though bookmarks can be designated as private, by default you can see or subscribe to any one’s bookmarks.  So far the site doesn’t have support for a “popular” items page by tag, but as use expands I can imagine that being included.</p>, <p>This is just a solid, attractive, easy to use social bookmarking service.  It’s easy to love. The current version was released last Wednesday and the developers say that the community will get to shape the feature set for the 1.0 release.  If there is an export option there now, I don’t see it.  I assume the developer community will make that happen.</p>, <p>If Markaboo didn’t work well or had limited options, I’d still be interested in it because the code is shared with interested developers through an attribution, noncommercial, share alike Creative Commons licence.

Wetpaint Launches: Wikis Evolve,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.wetpaint.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>Seattle based <a href=""http://www.wetpaint.com"">Wetpaint</a> has been in private beta since <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/06/wetpaint-best-wiki-software-so-far/"">March</a>. On Sunday night they launched to the world, allowing anyone to create a free wiki on any topic.</p>, <p>A good example wiki is <a href=""http://www.wikixbox360.com/"">this one around the XBOX 360</a>. Like <a href=""http://www.pbwiki.com"">pbwiki</a>, <a href=""http://www.wikia.com"">Wikia</a> and <a href=""http://www.jot.com"">JotSpot</a>, Wetpaint is a hosted wiki solution with wysiwyg editing (no need to use wiki code or html). Each wiki (and each page on a wiki) is taggable, and Wetpaint includes higher end wiki functions like page lockdown, privacy, etc.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/>I <a href=""http://techcrunch.wetpaint.com"">created a wiki</a> in about a minute and like the choice of templates. Wetpaint isn’t a fully customizable wiki, and you can’t run it on your own servers, but it is the best hosted wiki I’ve seen so far. Wetpaint is free, although all pages have contextual advertising included on them.</p>, <p>A lot of venture money is flowing into wiki products. Wetpaint raised just over $5 million in October 2005 from Trinity Ventures and Frazier Technology Ventures. The competition is well funded, too. JotSpot raised $5.2 million from Mayfield and Redpoint Ventures. Wikia has <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/27/wikia-raises-4-million/"">$4 million</a> from Bessemer and Omidyar Network. And while pbwiki hasn’t raised outside financing, it does have a <a href=""http://pbwiki.com/yahoo/"">distribution deal with Yahoo</a> that drives significant new users to the site.</p>, <p>Wetpaint is a little different than each of these. They are targeting the mass-edited wiki pages like Wikia, as well as smaller private and group wikis (think company project sites, intranets, social club sites, etc.). The service is incredibly easy to use (Jotspot comes close, but isn’t as mass-user friendly) – and it may bring a much larger audience to wikis than are currently comfortable using them.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/wetpaint565.jpg""/></p>]"
Verizon Wireless to Battle iTunes,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""verizon1.jpg"" height=""48""/>As our sister site Crunchgear is reporting <a href=""http://crunchgear.com/2007/08/21/buzzwords-aplenty-the-new-rhapsody-america/"">Verizon Wireless has gathered some powerful allies in its war with iTunes</a>. MTV and RealNetworks have joined forces with Verizon in a formation called “Rhapsody America.” The idea is to create an integrated digital music service that users can access by way of their PC, portable music device and mobile phone.</p>, <p>Former Urge subscribers and current V CAST and Rhapsody subscribers, will be able to use Rhapsody America to integrate all three music delivery systems into one easy to use service. If a song is downloaded onto your mobile phone, it can be sent to your computer.

Boxee’s continued struggle with Hulu suggests the content cartel has decided to double down on the <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2009/03/08/big-music-will-surrender-but-not-until-at-least-2011/"">hardball approach</a> while they still can make it work.</p>, <p>On the other side of the river, the technology companies are busy shoring up their runways. On this week’s <a href=""http://gillmorgang.beta.techcrunch.com/2009/03/08/gillmor-gang-030709/"">Gillmor Gang</a>, FriendFeed co-founder Paul Buchheit confirms his startup has enough money for the next couple of years. FriendFeed’s work in recent weeks has been on the back end, invisible to the user but proactive in forestalling the scaling failures so damaging to other social media platforms.</p>, <p>Next on the priority list (or at least high on it) is realtime search, aka Track. While FriendFeed has a complex UI and API underneath, Buchheit promises investments in simplification as Twitter users hit the power user wall and Facebook struggles to redefine its private architecture as a public stream. With Twitter growing rapidly and Facebook jumping in to compete in the micromedia space before it’s too late, FriendFeed remains the best source for deep investment in realtime information.</p>, <p>Once FriendFeed delivers a Track capability, third party developers will find fertile ground for realtime services in the enterprise. TweetDeck’s success stems primarily from a grouping function that allows monitoring of reduced flow in multiple tracks. Track goes an important step further, enabling customized filtering of the firehose and integration of those results with a social graphed stream.</p>, <p>As valuable as groups appear, they represent only a one-way view of the flow. Being able to respond in realtime transforms the new network from reactive to proactive, and from consumption to value creation. This is the moment the micropayment crowd has been waiting for.</p>, <p>The Hulu/Boxee tango illustrates the end game for the ascension of content as the power broker. No matter how hard the studios try to control the means of access to their content, all they are ultimately doing is defining the price at which they loosen the handcuffs. Take Comcast, for example. Its key value proposition is not immediately visible, but essentially resides in its ability to establish a two-way conversation with its customers.</p>, <p>Like a TweetDeck or a Twhirl, its initial value proposition is as an aggregator of multiple pay channels, voice, broadband, HD, and on demand. But as you explore the system, you discover that on demand becomes the real differentiator, as a kind of FriendFeed router for the rest of the services. Your time is the real delimiter, with HD’s data size turning the DVR into a caching mechanism you have to clear every other day to keep up.</p>, <p>That’s when you discover the on-demand archives of not just movies but premium shows, essentially sharing in a kind of peer-to-peer network the content you formerly “followed” and then watched or discarded. Catching up on shows becomes more of a magazine experience, for leisurely Saturday afternoons or late nights after the kids are in bed. And the money spent on video rentals begins to migrate into this new paradigm, even as some films are made available on-demand the same day they ship on DVD.</p>, <p>Viewed from this context, Boxee, Hulu, and the like become competitive only for those programs that aren’t bundled as on-demand: most of the ABC shows, the NBC shows that cost a dollar, and some Fox shows like House that are backbone of that network. Those, you record, watch, and release. The economics suggest more and more bundling will even out these early wrinkles.</p>, <p>That’s why the micropayments are finally coming to the net, based as with Comcast not on the walled garden of the studios but the time availability of the viewer. Given a flexible on-demand bundle, the user can create an optimal experience by time shifting. In return, this new form of bundling allows the marketplace of micropayments to be aggregated and subsidized by relationship marketing.</p>, <p>To remain in control of pricing, the studios now have to deal not just with the broadcasters but also the more specialized two way relationships common to the enterprise, where microcommunities can establish viable economics that can be leveraged through peer-to-peer sharing of on-demand shelf space. This equilibrium between creatives and suppliers is only now beginning to emerge, and will keep pressure on the studios and broadband cartels to maintain parity with the Web experience or risk being overturned by it. In the end there will be no difference.</p>]"
Mobile Shop with mShopper,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""mshopper.JPG"" class=""right"" height=""68"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/mshopper.JPG""/>Shopping from your mobile phone now got a little easier with mShopper’s release of a new platform for mobile phones. All aspects of shopping online are now available to bargain hunters with a mobile phone. Users can make secure purchases in seconds.</p>, <p>But as every good shopper knows, there is more to shopping than just buying. Research into price and quality has to be utilized before laying out hard currency. The mShopper application helps in this by providing prices and specs on thousands of products in real time. Up-to-date information in changes can be easily accessed.</p>, <p>And talk about easy, the mShopper search engine allows you to find a product with as few as two or three characters. For example, if a shopper is interested in a Panasonic HDTV, typing “pan” and “hdt” would result in a hit. If a search results in too many hits, additional descriptions can be added to narrow the field. This feature helps when shopping for something in a certain color or size.</p>, <p>Currently, over 100 vendors are taking advantage of mShopper. More than seven million products are showcased. This allows shoppers to compare prices for the same item and make the best deal. If there is a question about an item, mShopper includes Click2Call. Click2Call is a link to customer support on every page. If you have a question only a live person can answer, Click2Call will get you there without a tussle.</p>, <p>“More than 95% of all retail dollars are spent in traditional stores, yet online merchants routinely offer prices that are 20% cheaper, said David Gould, mShopper’s CEO. “With mShopper, the user can save time and money. Now people can go to the store, do their research, and then buy right through their phones.”</p>, <p>There are some disadvantages when buying online. Shipping costs often aren’t included in the price, so that 20% cheaper thing might not be so cheap if you are buying something heavy that has to be shipped to your house. And when I buy something, I hate to have to wait for it to arrive. Sometimes the extra frustration of waiting costs more to me than 20%.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.mshopper.net/"">mShopper</a></p>]"

At least that’s what the <a href=""http://mobilecrunch.com/2007/06/12/this-rules-not-really/"">Virgin Mobile ad campaign had to say earlier this summer</a>.</p>, <p>Virgin Mobile USA users can now share their feelings with like-minded people. The carrier has partnered with Intercasting Corporation to bring a diverse selection of social networking and community Web sites to its mobile carriers on the ANTHEM platform.</p>, <p>“We’ve built our success around empowering our customers and giving them maximum flexibility and control,” said Dominick Tolli, vice president for Virgin Mobile USA’s Mobile Data Services division. “There is a growing number of social networking sites that reflect different lifestyles and interests, and we’re committed to putting our customers in the driver’s seat: that is, enabling them to create their own individual experiences, determining how and with whom they want to communicate, whenever they like.”</p>, <p>The ANTHEM platform is designed to provide a Web-like experience for users. Among the social networking sites now available to Virgin Mobile users:</p>, <p>This service is available on Java-enabled Virgin Mobile handsets, including the Cyclops, the Slider Sonic and the Switch_Back phones. Plans are already in place to extend the platform to a wider variety of phones in the near future.</p>, <p>Pricing plans include the option to pay by the day or by the month, with 24 hours costing $1.00 (with a cap of half a megabyte of data), and $3.99 for a month, with a cap of five megabytes of data. We’ll be curious if power users cap out very quickly, and if Virgin has any alternate pricing options for those extremely <em>social</em> types. In the meantime, if you go over the cap, you’ll just have to make calls with the handset to be social. What a concept!</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.virginmobileusa.com/"">Virgin Mobile USA</a></p>]"
"Pickle makes photo, video sharing easy as email","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.pickle.com""><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/picklelogo.jpg"" style=""float:left;""/></a></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.pickle.com"">Pickle</a> is a new photo and video sharing service that emphasizes email and phone submissions and shared project pages.  Created by an Arlington based company called <a href=""http://www.incando.com/"">Incando</a>, Pickle is based on the premise that email is the dominant way that multimedia is shared and thus should be the basis of media sharing systems.  Despite some early beta bugs, the usability looks good and I really like the idea of encouraging people other than an account creator to share photos and videos on a project page.</p>, <p>Like too many media sharing services, I don’t see a way to easily export all my media I’ve uploaded to Pickle.  As we <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/06/16/why-is-flickr-afraid-of-zoomr/"">saw last week</a>, that’s a real problem.</p>, <p>The best thing about Pickle is the ability to easily create an email address that you or other people can mail photos and video to and have the attachments appear on a special project page.  Sports, parties, political events – it looks easy to document public events with Pickle and that’s cool.  Here’s <a href=""http://www.pickle.com/marshallkirkpatrick/102"">my Picklebox test page</a>.)  The idea is that I can set up a page just for one event, that page will have its own email address and privacy settings and thus control over collaboration is more granular than is the case in other systems.</p>, <p>The service also offers what they call Picklemails, emails you can send to people with your images and video compressed to they don’t annoy recipients.  The admin page is set up to look like an email inbox so that people will feel comfortable using it.</p>, <p>It’s really a well produced system, with features like commenting, slide shows, etc.  I can see it catching on with the e-mail crowd – and that’s most of the online world still.</p>, <p>The price point is steep, the site says $50 per year for standard upload, unlimited download and storage, but the company is offering $20 subscriptions to the first 25,000 beta testers. There is also a free level of service that comes with 200 mb monthly upload limit, instead of the 2 GB limit of the paid service.</p>, <p>Though things are changing, it is still relatively uncommon for one service to offer both photo and video sharing.  That, combined with the good usability of Pickle and its options for collaboration make me think this is a service with good prospects.</p>, <p><em>Hat tip to <a href=""http://go2web2.blogspot.com/2006/06/picklethis-is-what-video-photo-sharing.html"">Orli Yakuel</a> for this one.</em></p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/picklescreen.jpg""/></p>]"

Apple to Share Operators Revenue,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""Apple-logo1.jpg"" height=""96""/>AT&amp;T has the exclusive carrier license in the Untied States for the iPhone. It is too early to tell how profitable this will be for AT&amp;T.

L.A. Boy Scouts Giving Copyrighted Material The Respect It Deserves,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""right"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/patch.jpg""/></p>, <p>OK, so I’m an Eagle Scout. I have a suspicion that at least a couple of our readers are, too. It is with that spirit that I am sad to write this story. The Boy Scout Council in Los Angeles has begun a new program to award Scouts a “Respect Copyrights” activity patch. Guess what it’s all about and who helped come up with the concept?</p>, <p>According to the article, “The movie industry developed the curriculum as a way of emphasizing the ills of piracy to a generation that has grown up finding free music and video clips on the Internet.” The kids will learn to recognize copyrighted materials and how they can be stolen by all the bad men on the Interweb. They will also have to participate in one activity that shows how pirating can be harmful, one of the items suggested is visiting a film studio. Right. Because the Suits over at New Line aren’t going to be able to eat dinner at Spago tonight because I downloaded “Snakes On A Plane” the other day. This makes me sad on so many levels.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/technology/personal_technology/15809281.htm?source=rss&amp;channel=siliconvalley_personal_technology"">L.A.

84% of Americans to have Mobile Phone by 2017,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""SNL Kagan.JPG"" height=""48""/>SNL Kagan, a company that provides revenue projections for various communication outlets, predicts that in the next 10 years 84% of Americans will have a mobile phone. Mobile subscriptions are supposed to grow at a rate of 3% despite the fact that the American population is only projected to grow at a modest 1% rate. This growth rate is attributed to an increase in mobile data use, including Web, text and video services. Multimedia services partially or wholly paid for by advertising play a large part in the projected increase.</p>, <p>SNL Kagan projects total industry average revenue per user (ARPU) to grow at an inflation-paces compound annual growth rate of 1.5% over the next decade. This means the ARPU should increase from today’s $52.38 to $61.09 by 2017. Data ARPU is projected to be even stronger, with an increase from $5.92 to $8.58 by 2017.</p>, <p>“If carriers can hold onto their position in the revenue chain, data is poised to give them a second growth spurt,” says SNL Kagan senior analyst Sharton Armbrust. “While subscriber units and voice revenue will inch along, we expect data revenue to grow at a compound annual 14% rate over the next 10 years, rising to at least 22% of service revenue, compared to under 10% today.”</p>, <p>If data revenue is to grow, the American public is going to have to be sold the proposition that such mobile phone services are required. Mobile data is going to have to be sold as something practical, necessary and inexpensive. There will always be people who are interested in the latest gadget and application, but the majority of people want practicality. What is the advantage to me in watching video on my phone? Why do I want to text message someone when I can just call them? If I can use the Web on my PC, what is the point of doing so on my phone? If these and similar questions can be answered by manufactures and mobile service providers, SNL Kagan’s predictions may be on the mark. But projecting a rosy future based on what’s trendy today is bound to be disappointing.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.snl.com/media_comm/"">SNL Kagan</a></p>]"

Mobile Web Buyers Better than SMS Buyers?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""bango1.jpg"" height=""46""/>New research from Bango shows that consumers who buy content on the mobile web buy more content, and require less support and fewer refunds than users who buy content through Premium SMS. The mobile web also has three times as many add-on sales. This gives marketers a greater return for advertising costs.</p>, <p>“The mobile web gives consumers a payment experience they are already familiar with on the PC web,” said Martin Harris, Senior VP of Sales at Bango. “Because they can see the price and conditions of purchase before they click to pay and are billed, they feel much more comfortable with the whole experience.”</p>, <p>When text buyers purchase things like ringtones, games and wallpapers only 18% buy more than one download. Bango research claims that 46% of  buyers who visit a browser and buy through a mobile website purchase more than one item.</p>, <p>Mobile web customers also appear to be more happy with their purchases, asking for refunds in less than 1% of transactions.  SMS text buyers ask for refunds in 10-20% of all sales.</p>, <p>Caveat: Bango is a company that provides mobile phone web base services to entities that want to sell digital applications.

War and Peace or iPhone Bill,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""toiletpaper.jpg"" height=""96""/>Prodigious iPhone users have been receiving itemized bills from AT&amp;T that can number hundreds of pages long.  And every thing is itemized. Even a small 1K text message shows up. Some bills are so large they had to be sent in boxes. The size of the bills have enraged some customers, and not just because of their cost. Paper producing trees take years to grow and if this trend continues, Americans may be forced to limiting toilet paper use to one square per visit.</p>, <p>AT&amp;T doesn’t want to cause a national inconvenience in paper consumption, so yesterday the telecommunications company sent text messages to iPhone users that itemized bills will only be sent upon request. There is a charge of $1.99 for each itemized paper bill mailed out in the future. As of September 28, all of AT&amp;T’s new wireless customers will be sent a summary bill. Any current subscriber who makes a change to an existing account will also receive a summary bill.

Additionally, more than two-thirds (68.8 percent) of campuses participating in the annual survey have a strategic plan for deploying wireless as of fall 2006, up from 64.0 percent in 2005 and 53.3 percent in 2004. By sector, the proportion of classrooms with wireless access ranges from a third (31.7 percent) in community colleges (up from 26.8 in 2005) to almost two-fifths (58.0 percent) in private research universities (compared to 52.8 percent in 2005 and 47.4 percent in 2004).</p>, <p>It’s sort of interesting, because I’ve been on a lot of campuses in the past year and the differences between them can be pretty drastic. Louisiana State University (LSU), for instance, has wireless across most of the campus, while the University of New Orleans (UNO) hardly has wireless anywhere.

Linux Mobile Moves towards Standardization,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""linux1.jpg"" class=""right"" height=""96"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/linux1.thumbnail.jpg""/>The free operation system Linux is gaining more support in the mobile handset industry. Entities like the LiMo Foundation and the Linux Phone Standards (LiPS) Forum met recently at the Linux World Conference to support Linux as a mobile phone operating system. Supporters from around the world have made Linux a major player in the mobile phone business.</p>, <p>While supporters like the LiMo Foundation and LiPS Forum are made up of sometimes competing companies, the goals of the groups aren’t necessarily in conflict with one another. But time restraints may cause some rough spots.  As IMS Research Director John Devlin points out, “The LiMo Foundation intends to develop an actual mobile Linux platform which potentially will conform to the standards established by the LiPS Forum. However, since the LiMo Foundation has stated a desire to have products shipping as early as next 2Q08 (second quarter of 2008), they are working in advance of any final standards that will be sent by the LiPS Forum. This creates the potential for the LiMo Foundation platform becoming a de facto competing standard.”</p>, <p>The future of Mobile Linux may see the creation of an industry standard brought about by consolidation and inter-company agreements. In a recently published report, “The Impact of Cellular Linux,” IMS Research Analyst Alison Bogle accurately predicted much of what we are seeing come to pass. Bogle states, “There will be a period of acquisition and consolidation over the next few years, the Mobile Linux community will eventually standardize on one or two leading unified Linux-based platforms, which will become the de facto standards, and Linux will see strong adoption in the handset space based on the strength of the companies supporting it.”</p>, <p>If Mobile Linux can continue its journey towards standardization it will become a major player in the handset operating system arena. I would like to see one major mobile operating system become the world’s standard. This would make the connectivity of various services from differing service providers easier to translate on all mobile devices the world over. But this wish is coming from someone who would like to be able to play his old Commodore 64 games on the Xbox 360.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.limofoundation.org/sf/docman/do/downloadDocument/projects.sitecontent/docman.root/doc1006"">LiMo Foundation</a><br/>

Comparing SMS price comparison services,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">People say that mobile devices will be the key platform of the future, but there are quite a few things you can do already with good old SMS.   The launch of <a href=""http://mobsaver.com"">Mobsaver</a> this week got me looking around at a number of similar services for price comparison by text message and here’s what I found.  Even with a web enabled mobile device, being able to quickly send a text message to one contact number and get information back from a variety of sources is very appealing.  These services are smart, simple uses of affiliate links, APIs and ubiquitous mobile devices. The short reviews below appear in order of my most to least favorite ones.  There are other options that work outside the US, but for this write up I tried only systems that work in the US or return prices in US dollars.</p>, <p><a href=""http://tictap.com""><img alt=""smarterlogo.jpg"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/tictaplogo.jpg""/></a></p>, <p><strong>TicTap</strong></p>, <p><a href=""http://tictap.com"">TicTap</a> will accept messages containing UPC codes, ISBN numbers or search keywords.  When I searched for a particular audio CD, TicTap sent me back new and used prices on Amazon, the number of reviews that have been written there and the average number of stars given by reviewers of the CD.</p>, <p>TicTap can also be asked for recommendations of products similar to the one you are looking at just by putting the letter r in front of the item’s number.  Your search results are all saved on a page tied to your mobile number and on that page you can request that an email alert be sent to you if an item falls below a price you set.  Your searches can be viewed later by RSS, meaning you don’t have to log in or check on the system’s page for your account. TicTap says that its prices are synched with Amazon every 24 hours, so I don’t know how well the alerts would work for high demand products, but it’s interesting none the less.</p>, <p>I’m also encouraged by the fact that this service is in active development, having just released a WordPress plug in for contextual advertising, for example.</p>, <p><a href=""http://mobsaver.com""><img src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/mobsaverlogo.jpg""/></a></p>, <p><strong>MobSaver</strong></p>, <p><a href=""http://mobsaver"">MobSaver</a> got me thinking about all these types of tools and it’s got a lot going for it.  Its very simple and usable, though it doesn’t seem to work well with Verizon (Verizon’s fault, it appears).  An ISBN or UPC message to MobSaver will bring back results from both Amazon and eBay.  New and used prices are returned from Amazon and the range of prices currently available from eBay.</p>, <p><a href=""http://smarter.com""><img src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/smarterlogo.jpg""/></a></p>, <p><strong>Smarter</strong></p>, <p><a href=""http://smarter.com"">Smarter</a> searches by product model numbers.  That could be confusing.  I couldn’t get any results back from this service.  I wish they would just use UPC codes like the two above.  This is only one of many services this site provides.</p>, <p><strong>Other options</strong></p>, <p>Two other options I found were UpSnap, which appeared to return a list of local stores related to my search terms, and Scanbuy Shopper, which requires software to be downloaded.  I like the ability to SMS one contact in my phone and quickly get back helpful information.</p>, <p><a href=""http://ringfo.com"">Ringfo</a> does a text to speech search in Amazon by phone call.  It’s funny to hear a robot say “be sure to check Ringfo for a list of your items,” to remind me to click the affiliate links.</p>, <p>I would love to be able to search Craigslist by SMS, but at a certain point it makes more sense to use a mobile device with a browser.  This is a very logical way to combine affiliate links with ubiquitous mobile phones and I expect that increasingly sophisticated services will become available if services like these prove able to make a profit.</p>, <p>One risk, of course, is that users will cost the services the price of sending the SMS messages and will then buy online directly without using the affiliate links provided by the services above.  That makes it all the more imperative for them to add extra value to their services, like the email price alerts and who knows what else in the future, that will bring shoppers back to the service they texted.</p>, <p>For more mobile coverage, make sure to check out <a href=""http://mobilecrunch.com"">MobileCrunch</a>.</p>]"

"Swaptree Update, First Screen Shots","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.swaptree.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>A couple of weeks ago I wrote a <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/06/02/i-like-swaptree-but/"">somewhat negative post</a> about an unlaunched startup in Boston called <a href=""http://www.swaptree.com"">Swaptree</a>. Ouriel wrote a <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/06/05/splitgames-vs-swaptree/"">follow up post</a> comparing Swaptree (unfavorably) to a French service called SplitGames.</p>, <p>Since that time I’ve had a chance to talk at length with Swaptree founder and CEO Greg Boesel about some of the perceived shortcomings of the service that I pointed out. That conversation, and an eye-popping demo he walked me through, made it clear that I had made some incorrect assumptions about the service.</p>, <p>Swaptree will allow users to swap media items (books, CDs, DVDs and video games) with other users without the use of cash. Swaptree will not charge a transaction fee, relying instead on contextual advertising revenue that will be placed on the site. For a new user, the idea is that you type in a few items that you own and are willing to trade (using the UPC or ISBN code) and you’ll see thousands or tens of thousands of items that people are willing to trade for your stuff.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>My assumption was that Swaptree was going to have a difficult time creating a demand curve. Getting a new user to type in a couple of things they are willing to trade is easy. Getting them to type in things that they want and associate them with things that they already have to trade would be much more difficult. At the end of the post, I suggested that actual money served as a very nice stored value currency, and that’s why eBay has been so successful.</p>, <p>It turns out that Swaptree actually has a fairly interesting and much simpler way to build the demand curve of items. In addition to maintaining a list of items that a user wants to trade, they simply build a long list of items they want to own as well. This list can be created by clicking on items on the Swaptree site, or even easier ways like importing your Amazon wish list or using a plugin to click on items on Amazon directly and have them included on your Swaptree “wish list”. When I saw the demo, I was convinced that large numbers of users could be enticed to do this. If there is a match, any match at all between an item that you have and an item that you want, Swaptree suggests that a trade occur to both parties. If both accept, the trade is confirmed.</p>, <p>There are a number of really nice touches as well. Swaptree will analyze have and want lists and try to organize trades among as many as four users, so the possible number of trades increases exponentially. They also allow you to print out an address form and postage directly from your printer. They actually lose money on postage sales after credit card charges, but they felt is was important service to offer. They also have envelopes available and will send you new ones automatically as you use up the old ones. The list continues – basically Swaptree has done a very good job of thinking through the details and making swaps occur as easily as possible (Frankly I wish eBay offered these kinds of services as well).</p>, <p>Sometimes, I love being wrong.</p>, <p>The service is still some time away from launching a private beta, which I will eagerly participate in.

The Twuffies and the Twusties,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""warroom"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-1898"" height=""268"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/warroom.jpg"" title=""warroom"" width=""382""/>Dave Winer <a href=""http://www.techmeme.com/090312/p67#a090312p67"">joins a long list</a> of unhappy Twitterers including Leo Laporte, Robert Scoble, and new media stars who’ve not yet translated to the mainstream media hot list. Winer already has earned 20,000 followers the old fashioned way, and mostly he’s not pleased at having that number dwarfed within hours by inclusion of the Twitter favored list.</p>, <p>He, Scoble, and others suggest this awarding of Twitter Whuffie, or Twuffie is in fact a cash gift, one that by extending this logic should be declared on the next tax return. Certainly it’s good for business when 100,000 followers show up. Or is it? Let’s pretend this is a game show, and follow the implications of such a gift.</p>, <p>On a game show, if you win a new car you have several choices. You can drive it away, knowing that you have to pay taxes on the list price. If you have a comparable car already, you can sell that car to pay the taxes, or sell the gift and pocket the difference. Regardless of what you do, the value of the car drops to the actual change in your net worth. And in a down market for cars, the relationship between the list price and the book value (or the even lower market value) may be minimal.</p>, <p>Now to Twuffie. Let’s say that the list price is 100,000 F’s, the original (book price) was 20,000, and the market price is… what? If Winer, Scoble, Laporte, and Calacanis were each declared winners, what would happen to the 50 other people who would want in as a result? Would a silver and bronze award be meted out? If so, how would this affect the book price, which by all logic should remain the same as it was prior to the award?</p>, <p>So we have a previously stable book price and no way to trade that price to establish a market price. You can’t sell Dave Winer’s accumulated experience, political chops, and technologist rank to someone else, nor transfer ScobleRank to anyone else except his new employer, whoever that will turn out to be this weekend at 3PM Pacific on the Gillmor Gang.</p>, <p>In fact, flooding the market with artificial Twuffie does little more than slightly downgrade the value of 100,000 F’s. If you can’t buy into the earlier market, how does the juiced market change anything. To understand why this is not a real market, we have to understand what 100,000 followers means more than 20,000 real ones.</p>, <p>First, followers are not eyeballs except for the first few posts. If we zoom in on one of those 100,000, they have approximately 150-200 maximum people they can handle without Track, which as we know doesn’t exist. In effect, they have a few different quotas they have to manage, one of which is the Twuffie group. If they have 4 groups to juggle – say, Twuffies, Realies, Newsies, and Bizies – that’s about 40 or 50 in each.</p>, <p>We’ll leave the first two for last and start with the Newsies: there aren’t 40 of them, more like 20, and they are verbose. I love the New York TImes, but I don’t read every article or even one in 10, and if it’s a heavy news day the duplicates with competitors like the Journal and CNN start piling up fast. Noisy and bursty. Bizies are similar – like the Newsies but sourced directly from the newsmakers – Microsoft, Google, Apple, the Techmeme flow, the broadcast networks, the Cartel. It’s gossip triangulated for business strategic purposes. Maybe 30 of them, but hard to manage at that flow.</p>, <p>The Realies are the guys that do the real filtering of the first two categories, which is why they’ve built a solid audience based on ROI. You follow them, they produce good to excellent signal to noise ratio, and the Follow size tracks the real market value of the information. Here’s where you make up the difference between the allotment of the first two categories and what you actually use, maybe a surplus of 50 or more. Add that to your 40 or 50 and you’ve got a nice round 100. These guys pick their shots, so it’s less noisy and more valuable than any other group.</p>, <p>Finally, our Twuffies. If they were already Realies, they gain new customers for their proven services. They don’t get noisier, just more are made aware of them. If they are celebrities, they have to learn the business of not spamming and overwhelming the pipeline. If they are Newszies or Bizies, they’re not helped by being on the list because their business is siloed volume and they are pissing on their shoes unless they are really good at what they do on Twitter, in which case they’re already Realies.</p>, <p>The net outcome of the Suggested List is the increased pressure for Track services. Large populations of newbies will be drowning in a marketing swamp with no time or tools to parse the stream. Once the Twuffies stabilize, Newbies will have to find services to separate the wheat from the chaff, and inevitably they will show up at the Realies’ door with hat in hand begging for scraps of triage wisdom.</p>, <p>The Twuffies will soon want to be associated with Realies, preferably ones not on the List, to trade on their Twustworthiness. The Twuffies and the Twusties need each other, the former more than the latter.</p>]"

The biggest change will be that users registered as over 18 years of age will be required to enter the full names or email addresses of users under 16 years of age in order to contact them.  Usernames are sufficient to send a friend request to anyone in MySpace now.  The obvious flaw in the plan is that ill intentioned adults can easily register as being of any age, thus bypassing the adult-child restrictions.</p>, <p>Additional changes to be made include a new ability for anyone to mark their profile page private and removal of advertisements for adult services like dating sites on the pages of youth users.  Automatically making all profiles of users registered below the age of 16 might be more effective, but would likely make the service far less popular among children who enjoy meeting other children they do not know in the offline world.</p>, <p>There may be no definitive way to protect children online from adults who seek to harm them.

The company calls its new stage “zeta.”  Ether lets you set a price for people who want to call you on the phone.  The company provides a phone number, billing services and will also do pay-per-view for documents or other files.  A button on your website lets potential callers click for information about your services.  All of this for just 15% off the top of what ever you decide to charge callers.</p>, <p>Ether is a service of San Francisco based <a href=""http://www.ingenio.com"">Ingenio</a>, a company founded in 1999 that says it does 20 million minutes of paid voice commerce transactions each quarter for customers including AOL, Microsoft, YellowPages.com,  and the IRS.</p>, <p>Ether seems like a pretty cool model, though concerns are consistently raised about the quality of offerings available.  Looking around the site and doing a search for the Ether code in the blogosphere, probably the classiest case of this service put to use so far is by our fellow new web service review blogger, Pete Cashmore.

Pluggd podcast community launched today,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.pluggd.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>Seattle based start-up <a href=""http://pluggd.com"">Pluggd</a> opened their podcast directory for public use today; the company aims to make podcast listening easier for nontechnical users.  It has several features that I think look great.</p>, <p>Company CEO Alex Castro came from Microsoft, with an emphasis in multimedia.  The Pluggd team also has members with backgrounds at Real and ESPN.com.</p>, <p>Pluggd offers a few things that really differentiate it from other podcast communities.   A javascript bookmarklet lets you send podcasts you discover off-site to your Pluggd bookmark list.  That list is different from your subscription list so you can evaluate podcasts before subscribing.  As I test it, sometimes the bookmarklet works for autodiscovery of podcasts and sometimes it doesn’t.  Since the service launched just minutes ago, I hope that will be taken care of soon.</p>, <p>The Pluggd search engine actively crawls the web for new podcasts to index, instead of relying only on user submissions.  The podcast player can be put in a pop-up from the listening page, so you can navigate around or off of the Pluggd site without breaking the podcast you are listening to.  The site design is totally unpretentious without looking unprofessional, too, I like that.</p>, <p>The service takes two thematic approaches that are interesting.  First, Pluggd believes that social networking and podcast listening work well together.  That means that commenting and list sharing are available throughout the site.  Second, the company believes that the majority of podcast listeners are listening at work and at school, in a web browser instead of a mobile device.  There has been a growing chorus of voices arguing that prime time media consumption hours are shifting from night time to 9 to 5 work hours and Pluggd seems well positioned to respond to that.</p>, <p>The podcast directory space couldn’t be much more crowded, but I like this one.

Topics are grouped into six “containers”, including technology, entertainment, gaming, science, world &amp; business, and online video. The default view on Digg is still the technology container, although users can change that view and can also deselect individual topics within containers to further refine what they see on the home page.</p>, <p>There are other significant feature additions as well (we go through all of them in the <a href=""http://www.talkcrunch.com/2006/06/22/episode-10-digg-30-launches-interview-with-founders-kevin-rose-jay-adelson/"">podcast</a>). In addition to seeing what your friends have dugg, users can also just see stories more than one friend has dugg, further filtering new stories to what they might really want to see. Also, changing views between top stories and new stories won’t require a page refresh – Digg has added Ajax features (sparingly, they stress) to switch quickly between headlines and new stories, and among topics/containers.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>Digg is looking more and more like the newspaper of the web, and is <a href=""http://www.alexaholic.com/digg.com+nyt.com+slashdot.com"">challenging</a> even the New York Times on page views (Digg <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2005/11/09/digg-is-almost-as-big-as-slashdot/"">surpassed</a> rival Slashdot long ago).</p>, <p>About 800,000 unique visitors come to Digg every day, generating 9 million plus page views.

The blogosphere as a whole uses the word Photobucket 3 or more times as often as we use the word Flickr. (TechCrunch has used the word Flickr 11 times more often than the word Photobucket.)

If you’d like to develop widgets and have some one else deal with the details, this could be for you.  If you’re unfamiliar with widgets, see the “community powered search” box on the right side of TechCrunch – that’s a widget.  Videos, slide shows,  music players and news tickers that can be dropped into web pages are common types of widgets.</p>, <p>PostApp is headed and B2B veterans Ed Anuff, Giles Goodwin and Dean Moses. The company debuted its first offering, an eBay widget, in partnership with Typepad at the end of March.</p>, <p>PostApp will manage the process of turning web services into widgets that bloggers, social network users and others can insert into their pages.  Outside developers will create web services, submit them to PostApp for transforming into widgets and content publishers like bloggers, auction sellers and social network users will select the widgets they want from the WidgetBox marketplace. The service will also manage the money for widgets that involve financial transactions like affiliate links or subscription, though developers will have first say in determining the business rules of their projects.  PostApp will act as a master affiliate or subscription center, as appropriate.</p>, <p>As the number of photo, video, eCommerce and calendar widgets available online proliferates I can’t help but think that a central place for lots of widgets sounds like a good idea.  I also hope that this will make it easier for developers to create other kinds of widgets, as the choices out there can feel pretty stale.</p>, <p>One of the first highlighted widgets will use the Yahoo images API to insert contextually relevant images into any website.  RSS will be the basis of many, but not all of the widgets.  If you love RSS as much as I do, you can probably imagine almost any information being delivered by feed and thus displayed in a widget.

"Apple Rumors Round 5,253: iPhone Evidence and Giant-Ass TVs?","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/>As admitted Apple fanboys, we are 100-percent stoked to finally have our MacBook Pro Core 2 Duo on order. The rumor of this little upgrade has been at the top of the queue on the Apple sites, and his Steveness’s quiet launch is about what we were expecting.</p>, <p>But that moves the other rampant rumors up the column. Two that are appearing over-and-over again are the iPhone and the iHDTV.</p>, <p>The iPhone is all-but-confirmed by Cupertino, but now we have word that Apple has enacted a hiring freeze to make room for the carrier liasons. That’s plural, meaning Cingular might not have a lock on the iPhone at launch <a href=""http://crunchgear.com/2006/09/26/apple-iphone-to-cingular/"">as has been rumored</a>.</p>, <p>That’s all fairly well known. The new hotness revolves around a refresh to Apple’s stagnant monitor line. Apple has a reputation for its monitors that’s well deserved, and rumor has it that it will drop prices on its current lineup and add super-high-end 42″ and 50″ monitors. True, that has been circulating for awhile, but the new hotness is that these monsters would also feature HDTV engines, to double as your computer monitor and your TV. Chances are the monitor/TVs would also feature Apple’s remote, Front Row, and WiFi  to work with the iTV and iTunes Movie Store.</p>, <p>This would be a slick (but expensive) addition to Apple’s non-computer line-up, but would further its press out of the den and into the living room. It will be interesting to see if Apple turns its current LCDs into HDTVs as well, or if it advertises that it’s “iTV-ready”, which is what we’d suspect.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/archive/iphone_in_january_and_50_inch_apple_monitor/"" target=""_blank""><br/>

Big Blue Wants To Swallow Sun For $6.5 Billion,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img src=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/sun-rises-stock-chart.png""/></p>, <p>The consolidation in enterprise technology is upon us. Once mighty Sun Microsystems is now <a href=""http://www.techmeme.com/090318/h1015"">reportedly</a>; in talks to be acquired by IBM for a mere $6.5 billion.  That is two quarters of revenues for Sun.  If you factor in the $2.6 billion in cash and short term investments on Sun’s balance sheet, the true offer is closer to $4 billion.  <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=Java&amp;"">Sun’s shares</a> jumped this morning 65 percent.</p>, <p>Sun’s main Solaris server business has been suffering for years from the onslaught of cheaper open-source Linux servers, which it now offers as well.  But Sun still holds big presence in key industries.  The play for IBM is to consolidate its server market share in the face of increased competition from HP (which bought IT consulting giant EDS last summer), and now Cisco (which is trying to expand into the server and storage markets).  Sun’s commitment to open standards also meshes well with IBM’s philosophy.  Remember, it owns MySQL.  (Larry Dignan at ZDnet has a <a href=""http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=14817"">good analysis here</a>).</p>, <p>The acquisition would create an even greater mish-mash of technologies under the IBM umbrella, but IBM has never had a problem selling incompatible systems.  Sun also has a deep wealth of technology patents and engineering talent that IBM will be able to redeploy.</p>, <p>But if that is all that Sun has to offer IBM, any potential acquisition would just be tactical—a move to shore up market share in traditional data center sales until cloud computing changes the business entirely.  In fact, Sun is planning on <a href=""http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/03/16/Sun-Cloud"">announcing today</a> its own cloud computing offerings, which was recently bolstered by its <a href=""//www.techcrunchit.com/2009/01/07/sun-microsystems-acquires-q-layer-to-expand-cloud-computing-offerings/"">purchase of Q Layer</a>.  Sun’s approach to cloud computing is to offer enterprises mission-critical cloud alternatives which can also play well with the public cloud offerings out there from Amazon, Google, Salesforce, Microsoft, and so on.</p>, <p>That transition will take many forms, from turning corporate data centers themselves into one large virtualized computer to offering true compute, storage, and database services in the cloud.</p>]"
Discuss What You See With Phoja,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""phoja.jpg"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/phoja.jpg""/>This Labor Day weekend marks the 15th anniversary since I moved to New York City from the Midwest. In that time I’ve seen stuff that you’d only see in New York (or maybe Las Vegas or Venice Beach). In that time I’ve seen the rolling blading nuns, the jogging Elvis and a sad homeless woman whose only attire were garbage bags (the final one I’ve heard is a hoax, she’s really just scamming for the money). And I should add this isn’t during the infamous Halloween Parade in Greenwich Village. This is every day stuff that you see in New York, like the guys with fly fishing pools in Central Park – who happen to be nowhere near any water. In other words this is the stuff that makes me wish I had a camera with me.

Battle Test: Nokia E62 and BH-800,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""right"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/e61.jpg""/><br/>
The Nokia E62 is an interesting little beast. It looks like Motorola Q but it uses Symbian S60 platform rather than Windows Mobile 5. Additionally, the E62 is available on Cingular, so it utilizes EDGE “high speed internet” rather than EV-DO. So far so good.</p>, <p>The E62 is not a bad phone. It performs quite while in many of the most important categories. Its reception is clear and it is relatively easy to use. When paired with a Nokia BH-800 Bluetooth headset, the phone can be used virtually handsfree.</p>, <p><span id=""more-1928""></span></p>, <p>On a tangent here, the BH-800 is probably the best earpiece I have yet used. It’s tiny and attractive and it sounds great. On the technical side, it supports Bluetooth 2.0 with Enhanced Data Rate. A single charge can give about six hours of talk time and over 150 hours on standby. Buttons on the headset control power and volume and can answer calls. You can even make calls with its voice recognition capabilities.</p>, <p>The biggest problem I encountered with the E62 was a delay when switching between programs and menus. It has over a second lag time when simply calling up your messaging window. I guess this isn’t a huge problem, but it is a bit tedious when you’re trying to do stuff hurriedly—and I always seem to be in a hurry.</p>, <p><img class=""left"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/Nokia_BH800.jpg""/><br/>
Another issue is that the miniSD port is located behind the battery. Therefore every time you want to remove your card you have to pop the cover off and remove the battery. This can be a bit of a pain in the ass as the cover is temperamental about snapping into place.</p>, <p>The phone comes preloaded with a bunch of productivity options and seems to be tailored for more business-minded individuals. After a bit of coercing, I was able to get my Gmail working through the integrated mail browser — whether or not I was more productive after that is debatable.</p>, <p>I’d say the biggest hindrance of the E62 is the fact that it’s on Cingular. EDGE is sloooow. I used to think this was a problem with just New Orleans, but I’ve been on the road for the past few weeks and had the opportunity to use the E62 in both Chicago and New York, as well as in my hometown. Much to my chagrin, EDGE is just as slow in the big cities. Chicago actually turned the worst performance, with the phone frequently losing signal and then being reluctant to re-sync.</p>, <p>That said, the E62 did turn better EDGE performance than any phone I’ve yet encountered, but it still pales in comparison to the speedy EV-DO options available from Verizon and Sprint. As it stands, this is likely the best smartphone that Cingular has to offer. I’ve been using the Cingular 8125 (HTC Wizard) and I find the Nokia E62 to be far more useable.</p>, <p>Appearance-wise, it’s streamlined and stylish and fits nicely in ones pocket. I never once felt awkward talking on it. The phone holds a charge relatively well: I was able to leave it off the charger for about three days with a generally high amount of talk time. Also, while it isn’t a touchscreen, the 320 x 240 pixel, 16 million color screen featured on the E62 screen looks far better than the 8125.</p>, <p>So if you’re on Cingular and you need a touchscreen with true mobile broadband then you might want to wait until the 8525 (HTC Hermes) goes retail (soon). If can’t wait for the 8525 with its HSDPA enlightenment, then the Nokia E62 is undoubtedly the way to go. The E62 is available now for $149.99 with a two year contract and the BH-800 Bluetooth headset can be had for about $120.</p>]"

Zoho parent company <a href=""http://www.adventnet.com/"">Adventnet</a> is a TechCrunch sponsor.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/09/thumbstacks-ajaxflash-web-powerpoint/"">Thumbstacks</a> appears to be the primary rival faced by <a href=""http://zohoshow.com"">Zoho Show</a>, and both have certain advantages and disadvantages.</p>, <p>This newest offering is the 12th Zoho web based application, including a word processor, spreadsheet, chat, CRM, an app creator and more.</p>, <p>Zoho Show’s most important feature is that you can import Power Point (and open office) files.  That’s it’s primary advantage over Thumbstacks.  Unfortunately, there’s a 1 MB upload limit on those files, so substantial Power Point files won’t work.  Zoho files can also be exported to power point files or put up on the web with single click, whereas Thumbstacks exports to HTML.</p>, <p>Both Zoho Show and Thumbstacks offer remote controlled online display of slideshows, and both make it easy to toggle between public and private.  When private is selected, both systems display an error message if you try to load the public URL.</p>, <p>Zoho Show does not appear to support the creation and manipulation of arrows, which seems like a huge problem for presentations.  Thumbstacks does.  According to the Thumbstacks developer’s blog this was a real technical feat, browser support for arrows.  Instead Zoho offers some images of arrows that you can move around and resize.  I don’t look forward to having to do that.</p>, <p>Both services support easy import of your photos from Flickr, but only Zoho’s prompts you to login to access the photos you’ve marked private.  I can imagine private web based presentations being put together with private web stored photos, and if that’s what you’re looking for you may not want to use Thumbstacks.</p>, <p>Thumbstacks seems to have struggled on Macs since inception and has a limit of 5 viewers at once for slide shows.  Overall I get more error messages and UI struggles on my Mac with Thumbstacks, but being able to add arrows to my slides is very important to me.  While Zoho Show is a more polished offering from a commercial vendor, until they add support for arrows at least I can imagine myself using Thumbstacks to create most slide shows just for showing people over the phone.  I’d use Zoho Show if I was working on something collaboratively with people who use Power Point – and I’d ask them to put the arrows in it for me.</p>, <p>To be fair, the now 12 services strong Zoho suite is impressive. We <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/tag/Zoho_Writer/"">reviewed Zoho Writer</a> here when it came out and the company is obviously serious about improving their offerings over time.  Here’s hoping that Zoho Show increases its Power Point upload limit and adds support for arrows.</p>]"

Control Child’s Mobile Phone Usage with AT&T,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""ATT_edited.jpg"" height=""96""/>With school back in session, children are heading away from home and showing off their flashy new mobile phones. The calls to friends, text messages about a cute guy or girl, and cool downloads can add up fast. A new service called AT&amp;T Smart Limits for Wireless allows parents to set usage limits on their children’s mobile phones. Calling time, text messaging, instant messaging, downloads and access to Web sites can be controlled for safety and budgetary reasons.</p>, <p>Controlling the amount of time a child has on the phone can go a long way to keeping the family budget in order. But the service also helps protect children. Parents can block inappropriate calls, texts and Internet content by blocking numbers they find to be inappropriate and filtering access to content inappropriate for the child. This service is now available to all AT&amp;T customers for $4.99 a month for each line. No special handset is required.</p>, <p>Some might criticize and say such a service is only needed because of bad parenting skills. I disagree. A child’s brain is a child’s brain. Children do stupid things without thinking about future consequences. The temptations we put in our children’s hands with a mobile phone are too great not to expect some misuse. A hot new song or mobile game has to be downloaded if the child is to keep up with his or her peers. A friend may be going through a crisis and needs consoling.

Google Rumors: GPay and GPhone,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""googlemobile1.JPG"" height=""46""/>The publication of a recent Google patent has industry insiders speculating that Google is working on a mobile phone-based payment service. The service is being called GPay until Google announces or denounces this rumor. In tandem with GPay, there is growing speculation that Google will sell a low-cost internet enabled handset dubbed the GPhone.</p>, <p>The GPay system differs from other payment services as far as the user is concerned. The patent suggests that a user wouldn’t have to keep an account with GPay. GPay takes money from the user’s bank account and transfer it to the payee. It is unknown what type of fee would be incurred.</p>, <p>And nothing goes better with GPay than a GPhone, or so the rumors say.

Mobile Video not always Cellular Video,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""instat11.jpg"" height=""43""/>Mobile operators are spending billions of dollars to provide the infrastructure and new technology necessary to provide customers with mobile phone video capability. But a recent report from In-Stat says that competition from other mobile device video providers may cut deeply into the cellular providers’ expectations of huge video profits. In-Stat’s report could portend another bust cycle for telephone providers.</p>, <p>“Cellular operators may find that consumers won’t be as interested in their video offerings once other types of service are available,” says David Chamberlain, In-Stat analyst. “Of the five methods of mobile video delivery studied in a recent In-Stat report, two operate outside the current cell phone ecosystem, and a third—out-of-band video—seems to be allied to mobile operators for commercial convenience, not technological necessity.” All three, Chamberlain says, could bypass mobile operators altogether.</p>, <p>Some of the new competition sounds intriguing. In the future, current broadcasters could provide free video for mobile devices. Television is still broadcast over the airways for free and this could be done for mobile device consumption. The Japanese already do this with Japan’s 1-Seg.</p>, <p>A provider’s walled garden can be breached by in–time and place-shifting services like Orb and Sling Media. A walled garden is like the wall around the Garden of Eden, but without angles guarding the gate. A walled garden is a closed set or exclusive set of information services provided for users. It is a way of creating an information monopoly or a method of securing an information system. I prefer angles with flaming swords.</p>, <p>In-Stat research also shows that U.S. mobile phone users are apathetic towards video provided in an operator’s walled garden. Who can blame them? Suppose you get locked in a walled garden and there’s nothing but Apple iPhones to eat.</p>, <p>Video can also be delivered over 3G networks, which Verizon Wireless does. Or local cable operators can deliver video, like Sprint’s Pivot service. If the mobile phone video business gets lucrative, anything that delivers video anywhere will figure out how to get the video to mobile phones. But competition is a good thing. Consumers get better service for less money and technological wonders keep on the move.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.instat.com/catalog/wcatalogue.asp?id=231#IN0703669MCM""> In-Stat</a></p>]"

<img alt=""eamobile2.jpg"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/eamobile2.jpg""/>This week’s mobile gaming news has E-A M-O-B-I-L-E making a big score with <em>SCRABBLE</em>, which is now available for download in North America and Europe. The EA Mobile version is officially licensed from Hasbro, Inc., and brings the classic board game of wordplay to the mobile phone with simple controls and challenges for all skill levels.</p>, <p>“”SCRABBLE is one of the world’s most recognized board games and is a great compliment to our top-selling casual games,” said Travis Boatman, VP Worldwide Studios at EA Mobile.  “This new mobile version of <em>SCRABBLE </em>lets players choose from three fun game modes – short quick-play for a fast <em>SCRABBLE</em> fix, pass-and-play with a friend, or play against the computer’s dictionary for the ultimate vocabulary challenge.”</p>, <p>Considering that this game has always been about showing up your friends (associates and colleagues) with you large (copious and abundant) vocabulary and lexis of words, we’re not certain that this game will have the same appeal for wordplay know-it-alls. Then again, we just like showing off sometimes.</p>, <p><img alt=""scrabble.jpg"" class=""center"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/scrabble.jpg""/><br/>

Of 79 entries only seven received the Gold status, including <em>Professor Fizzwizzle</em> and <em>Frogger 25th</em>. <em>Frogger</em>… really?</p>, <p>“The mobile game market can be confusing for parents who are looking for family-friendly content they can trust,” said Joe Morris, vice president of mobile content, Konami. “Konami Mobile is very proud to receive two gold status NAPPA from independent judges who are experts in identifying products that are innovative, age appropriate and of exceptional and lasting educational and entertainment value.”</p>, <p><em>Professor Fizzwizzle</em> is a game where players must control the not-so-mad scientist and solve a series of increasing challenging puzzles across 30 levels. So that one makes sense that it would be an award winner, but frankly we’re scratching our heads about <em>Frogger 25th</em>. While the game is true to the original game, we don’t see why a parenting award is in order – this game doesn’t do much except teach you that crossing the street can be dangerous! Then again George on the hit 1990s sitcom <em>Seinfeld</em> was a <em>Frogger</em> champ… and look where he ended up!</p>, <p>Both games are available on major carriers in North America including AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon.</p>, <p><img alt=""konamiscreens.jpg"" class=""center"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/konamiscreens.jpg""/><br/>

The game will be available on both Brew and Java platforms.</p>, <p>“With its no-holds-barred, anything goes gameplay, <em>Blitz: The League</em> is an innovative alternative to the typical football simulation gaming experience,” said John Greiner, President and CEO of Hudson Entertainment. “Due to its success, we thought it was high time to bring the action to mobile, and we’ve done so with stunning results.”</p>, <p>Because this game has no official NFL tie-in or license (as is the case with the console version of <em>Blitz</em>) don’t expect to see real world teams or any superstars of the gridiron. This game is firmly based in fantasy, and not the fantasy football type of fantasy. This football game is more over-the-top than rival series including <em>Madden</em>, and the gameplay focuses on seven on seven action, along with a whole 12 game season. Whether this will score will fans as a result will need to be seen.</p>, <p><img alt=""blitzscreen.jpg"" class=""class"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/blitzscreen.jpg""/><br/>

The company will also be rolling out (no pun intended) Black Jack and Slots, both free for consumers to download from the Cellufun WAP site.</p>, <p><img alt=""Cellufungames.gif"" class=""right"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/Cellufungames.gif""/>“Casino games are a great fit for the mobile platform,” said Arthur Goikhman, CEO of Cellufun. “They are a little taste of Vegas while you have a few minutes to kill.  Sharing the bank across all of our casino games and including connected features such as progressive slots really enhances the experience of playing the games our users already know and love.”</p>, <p>The digital currency that you win (or are just as likely to lose) can’t be actually used for anything in the real world, but nor does it cost anything; however it can be used across all the casino games from Cellufun.

Well the crack marketing team over at Imation, the only company in the Americas capable of manufacturing blue-laser recording media, walks you through the “unique manufacturing process, technology and consumer uses of high-definition media” in a video on the front page of its Web site called “Imation: Into the Blue.” I shit you not people. My only wish was that it would include a cartoon disc called Beamer or Ray or Disky, but sadly, no, it’s just some guy taking you on a tour of the <s>cardboard box</s> Imation factory. Still, if you don’t know squat about how a Blu-ray disc is born, it’s worth a view.

ZapZap does social podcast directories right,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.zapzap.com""><img alt="""" class=""shot2"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/zapzaplogo.jpg"" style=""float:right;""/></a><a href=""http://www.zapzap.com"">ZapZap</a> is a new audio and video podcast directory service based in Japan, just launched this weekend.  While podcast directories are launching fast and furious, this one is particularly nice.  Ajax is used just right, digg-type voting is central, synch with iTunes or play on site.  The aesthetic is attractive and there are English and Japanese sections of the site.</p>, <p>ZapZap’s creator is an irreverent 25 year old named Jon Anthony Yongfook Cockle, born in England and living in Tokyo.</p>, <p>You have to wonder how sites like these are going to differentiate themselves from others offering similar functions.  ZapZap does have a full feature set, it looks great and being available in two languages is a smart move.  The only thing I’ve seen anyone offer lately that ZapZap doesn’t include yet is a javascript bookmarklet to tag an offsite podcast into your personal archive, as <a href=""http://pluggd.com"">Pluggd</a> offers (see <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/06/22/pluggd-podcast-community-opens-for-use/"">review of Pluggd</a>).  Tags aren’t used for categorizing podcasts, either; that’s one step ZapZap is considering when scaling becomes an issue, finding podcasts could become increasingly difficult when the number of offerings increases.</p>, <p>The little touches here are nice.  Each time a podcast you are subscribed to posts a new episode, it receives a “zap” vote.  It’s easy to email a link to an episode to someone. Subscribing is simple.  Offering a link to subscribe in iTunes instead of trying to compete with iTunes is smart.  The functionality is just plain smooth.</p>, <p>There’s no business model apparent yet.  Text ads could appear on the page.  Ordinarily I would be exasperated to see one more podcast directory, but this one really is good.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/zapzapscreen.jpg""/></p>]"
Kodak EasyShare C875 Review,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""center"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/DSCF0031.jpg""/></p>, <p>In the annals of photography, a few brands stand out as film juggernauts that barely made the jump to digital and, in some cases, died in the process. Leica. Polaroid. Eastman Kodak. How far the mighty have fallen, friends. Leica is <a href=""http://crunchgear.com/2006/10/19/leica-m8-goes-digital-expensive/"">aiming for the stars</a>, Polaroid is almost gone, and Kodak, bless its heart, is hanging on by a thread. Has old Kodachrome fallen yet? No, it hasn’t, thanks to easy to use entry-level cameras like the C875.</p>, <p>I have heard some complaints about the Easyshare line, but I used this camera for about three weeks and found few problems. As an 8-megapixel point-and-shoot, it is sufficiently simple to keep Grandma from accidentally taking snaps of her orthopedic shoes and offers enough quality to keep the mid-range camera user happy.</p>, <p><span id=""more-1943""></span><br/>
The camera is clad in chromed metal and has a 37-185mm lens with 5x optical zoom. The digital zoom is all but useless without a tripod. It has 21 scene modes, ranging from close-up to “baby” and offers on-board color and brightness adjustment using Kodak’s Perfect Touch technology. It also has an interesting panoramic stitching system which knits three photos together to make one large one.</p>, <p>All of this adds up to quite a bit of power in a small package that runs on two AA batteries, another useful feature for those not willing or able to remember to bring along a charger. It uses a proprietary USB cable under the SD/MMC card door and you control most of the menu functions with a little joystick and four buttons on the back. The “Share” button can tag images to print or, using Kodak’s own software, email, once you dock with your PC.</p>, <p><img class=""center"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/DSCF0033.jpg""/><br/>
All of this works well. If I gave this camera to my mother, for example, she would be able to pick it up and snap away, ignoring the scene modes entirely. Face tracking makes it easy to pick out figures on a busy background and the 2.5-inch LCD screen is easy on the eyes. The images on the LCD—and, to some extent, in the JPEGs this camera creates—are fairly grainy. They are, however, acceptable.</p>, <p>Now for the bad news. If you intend to use this for anything other than a few vacation snaps, keep looking. The close-up quality is fairly poor even in well lit conditions and the colors are washed out. Here, for example, is a scene taken with a Canon Digital Rebel XT.</p>, <p><img class=""center"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/IMG_3612.jpg""/></p>, <p>And here is the Kodak shot:</p>, <p><img class=""center"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/000_0005.jpg""/></p>, <p>Go ahead. Yell at me. Say I’m comparing a Pinto to a Ferrari. However, I’m trying to show how this camera stacks up against my benchmark DSLR. While the picture is fairly clear, these images were taken with a tripod in the same overhead lighting at the same distance. There is some grain in the Kodak photo and there is very little depth. The C875 has little depth of field, offering a flatter, deader image. The colors are also a bit washed out. Both shots were taken in “Automatic” mode with no alterations.</p>, <p>That said, if this is for Grandma or Mom for the holidays, then purchase away. Unless they’re WeeGee, this thing will work just fine. It is fairly large, about one inch thick by four inches wide, so it’s easy to grab. It’s also reasonably sturdy and some past issues with EasyShare aside, it is a serviceable point and shoot. If you’re looking for amazing photos, you’ve come to the wrong place. If you’re looking to take a few pics of Fido dressed up like a turkey, then by all means pick this camera up. It is available now for $299.</p>]"
"Digg 3.0 Launches, First Thoughts","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.digg.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a>The much anticipated Digg 3.0 launched this morning <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/06/22/digg-30-to-launch-monday-exclusive-screenshots-and-stats/"">as promised</a>.</p>, <p>My first thoughts are – it’s beautiful, although it isn’t stable yet (search in particular seems to be breaking, although there are other small bugs too). The integration of Ajax to move between topics and betwen headline and new stories is really well done, and is by far my favorite feature.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/diggbroken.jpg""/></p>, <p>With regard to the new features, I get the impression that Digg is trying to get good stories up to the home page as fast as possible, something I didn’t really pick up on in our <a href=""http://www.talkcrunch.com/2006/06/22/episode-10-digg-30-launches-interview-with-founders-kevin-rose-jay-adelson/"">podcast</a> with the Digg founders. At least three features seem to push this.</p>, <p>First, putting an “upcoming” stories tab right next to the headlines tab makes it much easier to switch between the two categories, so more users will look at upcoming stories too, instead of just reviewing the headlines. Second, the  “<a href=""http://www.digg.com/view/technology/upcoming/cloud"">cloud view</a>” (not a new feature) for upcoming area clearly shows which stories have momentum by making them bigger in the tag cloud – these stories will naturally draw more attention and diggs, more quickly pushing them to the front page than before. Finally, the new “agreed on” feature to see stories that at least two of your friends have dugg (in left sidebar) will again draw user attention to those popular but not yet headline stories. Combined, these features make it much easier for users to see stories that have a lot of momentum but aren’t yet on the home page. I will ask Digg if one of their goals is to get stories to the home page faster than before, and if the new features are successful in doing that.</p>]"
Warner Bros. offers video on demand through Guba,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.guba.com""><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/gubalogo.jpg"" style=""float:left;""/></a><a href=""http://www.guba.com"">Guba</a>, a pioneer in the user-generated video content space, became a pioneer of another sort today, when Warner Brothers’ film and television content went on sale on <a href=""http://www.guba.com"">Guba.com</a> at 2 PM PST. Through its deal with Warner, Guba will initially sell almost 200 movie and television titles (quickly expanding shortly thereafter), ranging from new releases like “Good Night and Good Luck” to ‘classic’ television content like “The Jetsons”.</p>, <p>Guba will offer two services to users. View-On-Demand (VOD) is priced from $1.79 to $2.99 and affords the user a 24 hour rental. Download-To-Own (DTO) will range from $9.99 to $19.99 for newer titles and allows unlimited viewing on 2 computers and 1 portable device, while allowing a single DVD burn for backup. The service will play content through Windows Media Player on a 640X480 screen. Downloads are progressive and will run up to 1.3MB/second.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>The deal sounds similar to the Warner/BitTorrent deal, but Guba is out to consumers first, so kudos to them. To be honest, my money was on Apple to get there first since the Pixar/Disney merger. But Apple’s power probably worked against them here. Having a broader online distribution network in place will give the studios more leverage in negotiations.</p>, <p>As to Guba being one of the chosen few, CEO Tom McInerney offered: “We treated the studios with respect, we listened and were responsive to their needs. Our proprietary technology gave the studios confidence that we could protect their copyrighted material and that our user-generated content could exist side by side with their premium content.”</p>, <p>I can’t think of any negatives for Guba in this deal. I don’t know how long it will last, but a lead is a lead and any differentiation in this space is a plus. Good buzz, extra traffic, and the goodwill of at least one major Hollywood studio, which might help them soon add another, will be a nice shot in the arm.</p>, <p>On the studio side, I like the concomitant release through web and DVD. It shows Warner is starting to get it. But what I don’t like in the deal is the pricing. While the VOD pricing seems reasonable when compared to a video rental, DTO is too high. Equivalent pricing through the two channels will hurt web uptake.  These are savvy consumers. Distribution costs through the web are lower and, while I haven’t reviewed the experience yet, I doubt the experience will be equivalent to a DVD. Yes, I know lower web pricing could raise the ire of Warner retail distributors. Still, since the move online is a test, now is the time to understand the effectiveness of lower pricing in the web channel. And, of course, a lower price point is also the best way to combat the studio’s biggest fear online — piracy.</p>, <p>In related news, see Paul La Monica’s <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2006/06/26/technology/movie_downloads/"">analysis</a> of the DVD v. download war. He thinks DVDs will be king for another five years or so. The end is almost certainly much closer than that.</p>]"

Now the major players in the mobile industry are in hot pursuit of delivering the same experience for pedestrians, commuters and travelers on the handset display.”</p>, <p>Berg Insight predicts that ad-funded services will account for an increasing share of the mobile navigation market. Local search applications can open the door to new ways for businesses to target consumers.

Cloud Service Bus,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""magic-bus"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-1963"" height=""286"" loading=""lazy"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/magic-bus.jpg"" title=""magic-bus"" width=""358""/>A <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrEHDV1e460"">heavy news week</a> has seen substantive improvements to the iPhone and Silverlight platforms, a Sun buyout rumor, Sun and Cisco weighing in to the Cloud expansion, and continued reverberations from Facebook’s full frontal assault on Twitter and the realtime stream. Any one of these stories would have sufficient legs by itself, but the combined jolts to the system add up to something bigger.</p>, <p>Apple’s iPhone 3.0 software announcements won’t ship until summer, but the implications for developers have already fostered some counter-shots across Apple’s bow from both Google and Microsoft. Steve Ballmer pigeonholes the iPhone as a $500 device with a ceiling of a small section of the worldwide market, with devices in the $200 range a broad Microsoft opportunity, while Android fans laud Google App integration and the lack of developer roadblocks as signs of a coup in progress.</p>, <p>But Apple has an iron grip on its lead in the market and an even surer understanding of what it will take to retain its dominant role in mobile computing. The 3.0 upgrade plugs virtually all the holes in the architecture, with Spotlight search across all apps the last feature that allowed Blackberry users to fight on. We can continue to complain about AppStore embargoes on video and VoIP over 3G, but Push Notification splits the baby for the developer market without capsizing the battery drain of background processing.</p>, <p>Indeed, virtually every iPhone application category shows significant signs of breaking out with the combined feature set. What Apple understands is the symbiotic relationship between media and carrier, with Apple the mediator and market maker. The New York Times app is now close to replacing the print edition from a usability perspective, and the ability to upsell extended features via on-demand subscriptions provides a rationale for the company to give away the store today.</p>, <p>Microsoft’s support for H.264 video in Silverlight 3 goes a long way toward ratifying the codec popularized by YouTube as the base video format of the Web. Much as Apple has locked down the avenues for competitors to make inroads on the heart of the elite mobile market, Microsoft is moving aggressively with Silverlight to establish a cross-OS platform on the desktop. Silverlight 3 is moving so fast there will be only one beta before release perhaps as early as the summer but certainly well in time for the PDC in November where Ballmer promises the Azure cloud will ship.</p>, <p>Scott Guthrie’s Mix ’09 keynote showed dramatic progress in developer tools for SIlverlight, essentially moving Windows development tools for desktop apps into the Silverlight environment. Silverlight’s new out-of-browser feature further blurs the distinction between a Windows app and a cross-platform (read Mac) app, as does deep linking to automate search engine optimization. Like Apple, Microsoft is using its deep platform control and investment in API tooling to stay open enough provide credible alternatives to open stack strategies.</p>, <p>Sun’s open strategy may not have had an obvious effect on the struggling company’s bottom line, but its R&amp;D investments appears to have attracted IBM in much the same way that Yahoo’s vulnerability encouraged Microsoft to try and acquire that other beleaguered Valley property. Sun’s moves in storage may also have triggered Cisco’s jump into the server market, as both companies try to consolidate their assets quickly under a Cloud umbrella. When Microsoft can <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd129877.aspx"">deliver</a> what used to be called the Biztalk enterprise message bus as a RESTian Azure service hooked up to AppEngine and Facebook, you can see why Sun may be the first of a series of dominoes falling that may end at Oracle’s doorstep.</p>, <p>Of course, a <a href=""http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/history_center/t_telegraph.html"">cloud service bus</a> can carry an activity stream, so Facebook’s Everyone opening of its tweetstream means that Twitter’s “control” of track is soon to be commoditized. Realtime search of the cloud message bus can now be accomplished (during Azure’s CTP phase) for free, and shortly afterward by any of the growing number of cloud players at a price that will likely approach zero as the stream is given away as a come-on for SLAs, security, and geolocation services.</p>, <p>Facebook is deadly serious here, like Apple and Microsoft giving users enough control of the services they need to bootstrap today in return for eventual allegiance to the code bases and tools they use to get there quickly. As Twitter goes from being the arbiter of access to an equal or perhaps weaker partner in monetizing the social cloud, the pressure to be acquired will accelerate.</p>, <p>For Microsoft, who needs a game changer in search, social search in realtime may prove sufficiently attractive at a time when a Twitter-esque service could be slapped into Azure with a minimum of effort. What better way to market the Azure cloud while finding the 15 or 20% search share where Google has no realtime clout? The last time I tried it, it took 10 minutes and then 2 hours for Google to index a Tweet. Why, you could even keep calling it Live Search.</p>]"
Farecast airfare prediction engine opens public beta today,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/farecast""><img alt="""" class=""shot2"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/farecastlogo.gif"" style=""float:right;""/></a>The airfare prediction <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/farecast"">Farecast</a> launches its public beta today, enabling travelers to leverage more than 60 billion records of past airfare prices to predict whether prices will rise or fall over the next 7 days.  The beta covers only flights departing from Seattle and Boston, but the company plans to roll out US-wide coverage through the end of this year.</p>, <p>The company showed me around the site last week and it looks really useful.  The primary upgrade from the private beta is the addition of ajax, making the functionality all the smoother.</p>, <p>The main brain behind Farecast is Oren Etzioni, the head of the University of Washington Computer Science Department’s Turing Center and the founder of search engine MetaCrawler.  With $8.5 million in funding from Greylock Partners, Madrona Venture Group and WRF Capital, Farecast development and testing has taken 3 years.  The company told me that about 20% of its staff of 22 are data miners or Phd scientists.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/farecast275.gif"" style=""float:left;""/>Users select departure and destination along with flight dates, then are shown a graph of past ticket costs, a prediction of the next week’s likely price shifts and a percentage of confidence in the prediction.  Tickets are then purchased direct from the airlines, except when multiple vendors are to be used, at which point Farecast works with Orbitz.  Advertising contextual to your search will be displayed near the results.</p>, <p>It’s nice to see data mining applied to more than watching you and me, for a change.  Presumably this kind of technology could have any number of different applications and systems like this are already used to cut down on industrial inefficiencies I’m sure.  Whether a new world of consumer facing data mining applications is responded to favorably by industry or whether they see it as a loss of leverage over consumers seems to be a key question.</p>, <p>Indeed, questions have been raised about whether airlines would approve of such a system; at least some say they like the fact that the purchases are direct from them instead of through a costly third party.  Other people have said that the airlines will just change their price patterns if the system proves successful in predicting price dips.  Farecast seems determined to have an amiable relationship with airlines and it will be interesting to see if they succeed.</p>, <p>Mike <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/05/26/use-farecast-to-find-flight-deals-or-just-fly-southwest/"">reviewed Farecast</a> when it went into private beta; he complained that SouthWest wasn’t included and always has the best prices.   SouthWest doesn’t open their prices to anyone and Farecast does include Southwest schedules in their search results – so it seems they are doing their best.  Whether it matters remains to be seen.</p>, <p>I know I tend to buy plane tickets without enough research, so I’ll be checking Farecast and it’s 60 billion plus observations, though of course I’ll check elsewhere as well.  If the company’s data is consistently verified by my anecdotal experience then I’ll be back for more.  Hopefully Portland will be added to the list soon.</p>]"

That’s pretty incredible compared to paper coupon redemption rates.</p>, <p>The number of participating merchants is small right now (7 total, including Hollywood video) but with a success rate like that you know more companies are going to be interested.  Will consumers want to download software to their phones, check for coupons at large retailers and hold up their phone displays in front of check out staff for a discount?  The company says that dedicated software is perceived as far less intrusive than SMS messages and that makes sense.</p>, <p>I’d say it could work, but it looks like it already has in early tests.  Will the rest of the world go as California goes?  Will people continue to use the software after the novelty runs out?  We shall see.

T-Mobile HotSpot @ Home Hands On,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/>Just launched (only) in Seattle, T-Mobile HotSpot @ Home is a service that lets you switch your call from cellular to WiFi both seamlessly and invisibly.

Do Brains Like Mobile Phones?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""2716052591.jpg"" height=""83""/>A recently published study exploring the effects of frequent mobile phone use on the brain claims long-term exposure slows brain functions. But at the same time, frequent mobile phone users showed better focused attention. No conclusions can be drawn as to whether these effects are adverse to health or not, but data has been collected from more that 20,000 people to replicate this study and further investigate health risks. What is a brain to think?</p>, <p>In the September issue of the <em>International Journal of Neuroscience </em>a study will be published on the long term effects of mobile phone use on brain function. Past studies have investigated the acute effects of mobile phone use on brain function. But this study employs an epidemiological approach to investigate the long-term effects of mobile phone use on brain function.</p>, <p>In this study 300 people were broken into three groups of 100. A third were ‘frequent mobile phone users’, a third ‘intermediate users’ and a third ‘non-mobile phone users’. Brain activity was measured using Quantative EEGs. Neuropsychological functions such as attention, memory and executive function were measured. Personality traits were also assessed.</p>, <p>Frequent mobile phone users tended to be more extraverted. The study considers the extraversion to be a cause for using mobile phones more, not an effect from using mobile phones. But the study did find that frequent use of mobile phones trains the brain to be more focused. Making calls in busy environments increases attention by training the brain to filter out irrelevant environmental information while talking on the phone.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, the brain activity from frequent mobile phone users shows more slow activity (increased Delta and Theta) and a slowing of the Alpha Peak Frequency, interpreted as a general slowing of brain activity. Slowed brain activity could not be explained by personality traits or environmental conditioning.</p>, <p>   “In Alzheimer’s dementia you also find a severely slowing of brain activity. However, the slowing found in this study, with mobile phone users, can still be considered within ‘normal’ limits” according to Martijn Arns, the main investigator. “The frequent mobile phone user group used their mobile phone – at the time of data collection – only 2.4 years on average which can currently be considered as a short time. Therefore, it is to be further investigated whether the observed effects in this study are more severe with prolonged mobile phone use” according to Martijn Arns.</p>, <p>If this study proves to be accurate, in the future psychiatrists may prescribe mobile phone use instead of drugs. If a child has Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) what better medicine than daily phone calls from a noisy mall to friends? Exercise that brain to concentrate, don’t medicate. Maybe people with a sleeping disorder could call up soothing music and place the phone on the pillow for some brain downtime.</p>, <p>Of course, all these studies about the effects on the health of mobile phone users may be meaningless. Remember how a few months ago mobile devices were being blamed for the disappearance of honey bees? It turns out they caught a virus. It is too early to panic about the dangers, or brag about the benefits, of the effects of mobile phone use. That’s what a brain is to think.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/00207454.asp"">International Journal of Neuroscience</a></p>]"
A look inside PeopleAggregator,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.peopleaggregator.net""><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/peopleagglogo.jpg"" style=""float:left;""/></a>Marc Canter’s much anticipated <a href=""http://www.peopleaggregator.com"">PeopleAggregator</a> is starting to roll out, password protection is scheduled to be removed Wednesday around noon Pacific time.  PeopleAggregator is the product of 3 years of self funded work by Canter to bridge the gap between all the online social networking services available and move the industry towards a standards-based place of collaboration.  I took a look inside the system today and talked to Canter on the phone.  I wasn’t convinced that this was important before today – but now I am.</p>, <p>Canter was the founder of a company called MacroMind in the 1980’s.  MacroMind became Macromedia and Canter says he’s paying penance today for the role he played in locking users into Macromedia Flash.  PeopleAggregator is all about using open standards to prevent lock-in in one of the most important sectors of the new web – online social networking.</p>, <p>Here’s how it works.  <a href=""http://peopleaggregator.net"">PeopleAggregator.net</a> will be a fully functioning online social network in and of itself, but it will share information with other services through common identity standards for our profiles and through APIs (application programming interfaces) for our writing, multimedia and contacts.</p>, <p>Perhaps most important, PeopleAggregator will also provide new social networks with hosted software and later next month will offer downloads of the software for organizations who prefer to host it themselves.  Licenses will be free for nonprofits and will cost commercial ventures a one-time sum <em>after</em> they successfully monetize the system.</p>, <p>What this means is that it will be easy to come and go from new social networks, instead of being locked in to one just because you’ve put the time and energy into using your account there.  Instead of being at the mercy of one centralized database and service, if Canter’s vision succeeds then countless social networks will proliferate with unique styles and function but with interoperability.</p>, <p>You can currently log in to PeopleAggregator with a LiveJournal or Flickr ID and cross post automatically to LiveJournal, Xanga and any other system that uses the Blogger, Atom or Metaweblogs APIs.  Microsoft recently announced the renaming of its new open identity standard, CardSpace, and that will be one of many identity standards supported by PeopleAggregator.  Canter expects AOL, Yahoo and Beebo to get on board soon – MySpace will be the hard one, he says.</p>, <p>Canter says he’s got big plans for RSS parsing by item type, with access control for friends, etc.  The site already has a nice UI for structured blogging, something I never thought I’d be interested in.  The use of a graphic interface, linked to forms that tag new content as a blog post, an event listing, a product review, etc. is so easy in PeopleAggregator that I can imagine myself and others using it happily.</p>, <p>I enjoyed testing PeopleAggregator out, and it solid enough with a few bugs, but what’s most exciting is that any problems I have with its interface, culture or rules are no big deal – I can just take my identity, blog posts and pictures over to another social network that supports open standards and that I like better.  That’s power for users.</p>, <p>I talk to people creating new social networks regularly.  I always ask them if they are supporting open identity standards.  None of the other startups I talk to are.  Here’s a way to do that and thus win loyal users through trust instead of lock-in.<br/>

<img alt=""eidosmobile.jpg"" class=""right"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/eidosmobile.jpg""/>Things are total <em><strong>Pandemonium</strong></em> over at Eidos Interactive, which is set to release the popular game from Crystal Dynamics. Originally developed as a console game more than a decade ago, this new version faithfully recreates the 1997 classic, complete with a 3D in-game camera. The stars Nikki, a wizard in training (move over Harry Potter), and Fargus, a deranged jester with an even more deranged puppet sidekick called Sid. Together these balls must explore 18 epic 3D worlds.</p>, <p>“<em>Pandemonium</em> represents a whole new level of gaming experience on mobile phones,” says Dave Clark, vice president of New Business Development at Eidos “The graphics remain strikingly faithful to the original game on console and, as levels load while you play, gamers will enjoy a seamless gaming experience. This is head and shoulders above what most people imagine when they think of games for the phone.”</p>, <p>If you don’t remember this one, fear not. It was one of the few notable titles on the SEGA Saturn before arriving on the PlayStation 3 and Nokia N-Gage. Hopefully this time the <em>Pandemonium</em> will be a little more memorable, as the game makes its debut on BREW-enabled handsets.<br/>

No surprise there. And the line up sounds noteworthy too, with titles including Hexic and Mozaki Blocks, both from Alexei Pajitnov, one of the creators of Tetris.</p>, <p>In addition to those two titles, this line up of 11 games includes Slinky, a mobile version of the spring, the spring, a wonderful spring; Fish Tycoon, a mobile version of the popular PC game, and Bubble Town, an arcade-styled puzzle game.</p>, <p>“I-play has always been committed to driving the mass-market casual game genre on mobile,” said David Gosen, president of I-play. “The combination with Oberon with their leading position within the online games market provides the ideal opportunity to drive real growth to this vital market sector and demonstrates one of the many synergies being delivered by the linking of the two companies.”</p>, <p>There is no doubt that mobile gaming is going to continue to be big on mobile phones, and it is refreshing to see a continued push with easy to play casual games. While we’re still watching to see hardcore games make headway into the mobile space there is no doubt that playing it casual could be mobile’s best asset.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.iplay.com"">I-play</a></p>, <p><strong>Glu Sticks To Inc 5000</strong><br/>

"ShopWiki to spend $25,000 on user submitted videos","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.shopwiki.com""><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/shopwikilogo.jpg"" style=""float:left;""/></a><a href=""http://www.shopwiki.com"">ShopWiki</a>, an incredibly innovative online shopping community, will announce today another step to expand their service’s offerings.  The company will pay users $50 per video for the first 500 submitted product review videos selected for inclusion on the site – that’s $25k total.  This site is nuts already and paying people to add video reviews is going to take it over the top in terms of usefulness.  Or maybe it’s just really cool.  I’m not Mr. Online-shopping by a long shot and even I think ShopWiki is loads of fun to use.</p>, <p>The company was founded last year by Eliot Horowitz, former <a href=""http://www.doubleclick.com/"">DoubleClick</a> CEO Kevin Ryan and DoubleClick Co-founder and former CTO Dwight Merriman.  It’s self funded and aims to profit only from contextual advertisements.  Its feature set is awesome.</p>, <p>ShopWiki says it crawls more than 120,000 online stores for its search results.  Its search engines understand complex natural language queries. There’s a price slider and user written reviews.</p>, <p>The two most notable features to date have been user written and edited (but ShopWiki vetted) wiki buying guides for more than 1,200 item types and a color wheel that will filter your search results by the color of the item.  The color wheel was launched just last week and is really quite a technological feat in and of itself.</p>, <p>The further inclusion of user created short videos about various products is likely to be a powerful addition to this already very impressive site.  Lest you think that a start-up paying that much money for user generated content indicates Bubble 2.0, think about the subject matter at issue.  All the lip-synched music videos in the world probably aren’t worth 25k, but product reviews by users just may be.    Shopwiki already adds value to the user experience by leveraging users’ writing in its company-vetted wiki shopping guides.  The availability of select videos on key pages should carry this strategy even further.</p>, <p>Whether the timeliness of those videos will be maintained in time-sensitive sectors like electronics is a question – but if a system like this takes off then many people will want to be the face in the newest iPod review video.  The best video of all those submitted for that page should be worth well more than $50 to ShopWiki.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""border"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/shopwikiscreen.jpg""/></p>]"
Confessions of the Knife: Samsung Revisits the Blade,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""right"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/a900mc.jpg""/><br/>
<a href=""http://www.crunchgear.com/category/best%20bytes""><img/>I was locked in an unforgiving contract through the RAZR-fad so thankfully, unlike Gavin, I was never swept in the fray. Despite never owning one, it was impossible not to notice the now-ubiquitous-phone. Even in New Orleans, it’s everywhere. I don’t think I can leave the house without laying eyes on one.</a></p>, <p>The funny thing that was always apparent to me, was that the RAZR was an inferior product to Samsung’s A900—the Blade. Sure the RAZR came first, trailblazing the field of slim and sexy in cell phones, but who cares? Samsung did it better.<br/>
<span id=""more-1964""></span></p>, <p>The beauty was that Samsung managed to sample the style and feeling of the RAZR yet still make its phone feel different enough to be a compelling alternative. This month Samsung quietly launched the slightly updated A900M on Sprint.</p>, <p>There are few updates to this model, but the phone continues to be a clear winner in the slim class. The main variation is an updated case. Samsung has exchanged some of the metal casing for high impact plastic. I’m always worried when I hear metal is being exchanged for plastic, but there really isn’t an issue here. The phone feels completely solid—more so than any phone I’ve ever owned. The reason plastic was swapped in is that many users were complaining about case dents. The plastic additions seem to have remedied that problem.</p>, <p>Another change is that the A900M features customizable themes. Users can change menus amongst several presets or personalize them further. Not really that big of a deal, but perhaps this will appeal to the high school cheerleader in you.</p>, <p><img class=""center"" src=""http://static.flickr.com/80/256176970_609f215131.jpg?v=0""/><br/>
Functionality-wise, the phone remains the same, but for those of you unfamiliar with the A900, here are a few details. The Blade has the best call quality I’ve tested from any phone in this class. Furthermore, the camera is easily the best of any phone I’ve ever used, period. The picture of me you see there was taken with the A900M and it’s good enough that it’s become my official profile picture.</p>, <p>It also features an MP3 player that I can’t say I ever really put to much use. It sounds OK, but with the lack of microSD, it’s essentially useless. To be honest, I’ve had trouble finding many people who use their phones for MP3s anyway, so I can’t see this being much of an issue for anyone.</p>, <p>Finally, like its older brother, the A900M supports EV-DO, so you can expect nice and fast mobile broadband wherever you’re at. I could never get DUN to work, but I think there is some sort of hack you can use to enable it.</p>, <p>Anyway, I’m disappointed that this revision features so little revising, but still feel confident that the Blade is superior to the RAZR. It’s available now on Sprint for $99.99 with a two year contract and a mail in rebate.</p>]"
Meebo Extension for Flock,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">A UK developer who goes by “Tones” has created a <a href=""http://gis.stcstm.org/meebo-extension/"">Flock-specific extension</a> that puts Meebo, and therefore Yahoo, AIM, Gtalk and MSN IM, directly into a sidebar in the Flock browser (the extension also works for Firefox). Since Flock and Meebo are two startups I use, this looked interesting.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>I’ve downloaded the extension and tried it out. It works as promised, although it requires constant re-sizing of the IM windows to make it work right. Until the kinks are worked out (possibly via Meebo’s support of the project, which I encourage), I don’t recommend using it.</p>, <p>But I do support the idea behind this entirely. IM should (optionally) be pulled right into the browser, where most of the action on a computer today occurs anyway. There should be no need to use a separate set of clients on the desktop for IM, or even go to Meebo’s website. Just as Flock has built a photo uploader directly into the browser (for flickr and photobucket), they should integrate IM functionality directly into it as well.</p>, <p>More TechCrunch posts on <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/tag/flock"">Flock are here</a> and <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/tag/meebo"">Meebo are here</a>.</p>]"
Adobe Launches Flex 2,"[<p id=""speakable-summary"">Adobe <a href=""http://weblogs.macromedia.com/flexteam/archives/2006/06/flex_2_released.cfm"">launches</a> the Flex 2 product line tomorrow along with Flash Player 9. Flex is a web web development environment used by programmers to build rich web applications that can make use of Flash and/or Ajax. The main advantage of Flex is that it makes developing Flash applications a lot easier, and easily combining it with Javascript to make full feature-rich web applications. Many development suites have made claims in the past to ease the development process with rich web applications, but most developers still stick to using just text editors and Javascript libraries as the simple approach offers most flexibility.</p>, <p>Flex seems to be on the right track, offering a powerful environment that will allow the developer to build either Flash applications, and in the future, full Ajax applications. The IDE is based on Eclipse, which is already very popular and is open source. Flex adds support for syntax completion, an integrated compiler and a realtime debugger that will save a lot of the common pain with debugging web applications.</p>, <p>Adobe has a new pricing mechanism for the Flex platform, but the basic Flex SDK is now free. There are many different options in this space, the most popular being the open source web application development environment <a href=""http://www.openlaszlo.org/"">OpenLaszlo</a>. With what is already a great feature set and the ability to work well with other Adobe applications I am sure that Flex will be a hit with wep application developers who would like to build cool apps, but who don’t have the patience to learn the finer details of ActionScript and Javascript. Adobe have listed a large number of <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/?tab:samples=1"">sample applications</a> that were built using Flex on their website, and also have a large number of <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/"">developer resources</a>.</p>, <p>Bill McCoy, GM of Adobe’s ePublishing Business, has an overview of the announcement <a href=""http://blogs.adobe.com/billmccoy/2006/06/flash_player_9.html"">on his blog</a>.

Zlango's Icon-based Language for SMS,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.zlango.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a><a href=""http://www.zlango.com"">Zlango</a> is a new Israeli startup (there is a lot of <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/01/lunch-in-israel-six-startups-and-a-vc/"">innovation</a> <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/05/01/a-new-look-at-personalized-news/"">going</a> <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/04/21/confess-your-secrets-i4giveu/"">on</a> <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2006/03/21/checking-out-esnips/"">there</a>) that has created a very interesting new language and associated application that could change the SMS landscape (as well as, eventually, email and IM). Israel design firm <a href=""http://www.mantis.co.il/"">Mantis</a> is involved with the project.</p>, <p>The language is based on icons, or pictures. Each icon has a specific meaning – a person pointing to himself for “me” or a heart for “love”. There are over 200 icons included in the Zlango language today.</p>, <p>Users of the service download a thin 64K Java or Brew application for their GSM or CDMA phone. The application converts the icons into a SMS message and then re-translates back to icons at the receiver phone. To see how it works visually, check out the flash tour <a href=""http://www.zlango.com/pop.aspx?page=guide&amp;guideId=1"">here</a> and then try out the simulator <a href=""http://www.zlango.com/content.aspx?page=try"">here</a>.</p>, <p><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/>At first glance this is nothing more than a nifty piece of mobile software and a way to send icon based messages over inexpensive and ubiquitous SMS networks.</p>, <p>But I think the cultural implications of Zlango may be much deeper.</p>, <p>First, two users can communicate using Zlango even if they do not speak the same language. The cross-cultural implications are obvious.</p>, <p>Second, Zlango is not a static language. Rarely used icons will disappear over time, and new icons will be added to the language. <strong>One thing that isn’t clearly addressed on the site, though, is whether users will be able to evolve the language directly as happens with spoken language.</strong> Allowing users to create, use and share their own icons, some of which will eventually make it into mainstream usage, will be critical for Zlango’s success in my opinion.</p>, <p>Zlango claims that user testing shows that “the majority of youth who tried it, felt comfortable to say that they commanded the language in less than one hour.” After testing the <a href=""http://www.zlango.com/content.aspx?page=try"">simulator</a> for just a few minutes, I believe that to be true. Complex messages can be created in just a few keystrokes, much faster than normal SMS.</p>, <p>I don’t know if this will catch on with users or not – we’ll have to wait for the upcoming launch to see. Downloading the software is certainly a barrier to adoption and I suspect Zlango will focus on doing deals with carriers to build this directly into phones. They’ll need mass adoption quickly to ensure that copycat services don’t destroy the potential network effect before it has time to establish itself. But all that being said, it’s intruiging to see the birth of a new icon-based language and watching this spread virally, or not, will be interesting.

The Wireless Association Unhappy with Last Night’s FCC Vote,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""9780740718571-s.jpg"" height=""96""/>The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) last night adopted a Report and Order (Order) which clarifies that wireless carriers must meet the Enhanced 911 (E911), Phase II location accuracy requirements at the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) service-area level.  To accomplish this, the Order requires carriers to meet interim, annual benchmarks over the next five years in order to ensure that they achieve PSAP-level compliance no later than September 11, 2012.</p>, <p>  The Commission’s adoption of this Order further ensures that E911 service meets the needs of public safety and the American people.  The primary objective of today’s Order is to advance policies, rules and initiatives that support the efficient and reliable transmission of meaningful automatic location information from wireless 911 callers to PSAPs to better ensure rapid emergency response and save lives. And the Commission’s action has received widespread support from the public safety community.</p>, <p>To ensure that carriers are making progress toward compliance with the location accuracy requirements at the PSAP level, the Commission has established a series of interim requirements.  These annual benchmarks include interim progress reports, as well as requirements to measure the Commission’s accuracy requirements on progressively smaller geographic levels until the PSAP-level is met.  This includes:</p>, <p>•	Fulfilling the Commission’s location accuracy requirements within each Economic Area in which a carrier operates by September 11, 2008;<br/>
•	Satisfying the location accuracy requirements within each Metropolitan Statistical Area and Rural Service Area that the carrier serves; and demonstrating significant progress toward compliance at the PSAP-level, including achieving this requirement within at least 75 percent of the PSAPs the carrier serves, by September 11, 2010; and<br/>
•	Achieving full compliance with the PSAP-level location accuracy requirements by September 11, 2012.</p>, <p>As part of their efforts to achieve compliance with the interim benchmarks, wireless carriers must account for only those PSAPs in their service areas that are capable of receiving E911, Phase II location data.</p>, <p>The Wireless Association President and CEO Steve Largent responded this morning with the following statement:</p>, <p>“The wireless industry is proud of its comprehensive efforts to bring Enhanced 911 service to American consumers. To date, billions of dollars have been invested so that consumers can wirelessly contact public safety in their time of need. America is safer for it.</p>, <p>“CTIA – The Wireless Association® and the wireless industry are committed to improving location accuracy. Today’s action by the Commission will hamper that important effort.</p>, <p>“In addition to today’s item being procedurally flawed, I am concerned that the Commission’s action may lead to unrealistic – and potentially harmful – consumer expectations. I had hoped the Commission would move forward in a collaborative effort involving experts from industry, public safety, and government.

I love it when the cross-pollination between consumer services and business use starts with consumer practices and this is just one of many such developments recently.  ConnectBeam makes tagging items into personal or shared archives simple, even in company intranets.  It’s a straightforward use of social bookmarking technology with some nice touches and a fundamental business orientation.</p>, <p>Lead by Puneet Gupta and Prem Malhotra in Newark, California the company originated as a system for students.  After academic publisher Reed Elsevier and other large vendors expressed interest in putting the system to use for business, ConnectBeam was reborn.  Gupta told me that they are engaged in encouraging conversations with a number of large potential customers and are actively seeking funding as well.</p>, <p>I was impressed with ConnectBeam, both in terms of ease of use and security.  The site is designed to incorporate just a little social networking into bookmarking activities.  Users get their own archives, organized in topical pages, and can invite others inside or outside their company to view and/or contribute links to those pages.  That permission can also be revoked, which is nice.  Intranet pages behind a firewall can be bookmarked and accessed through IP validation.</p>, <p>User accounts are created in connection with your work email domain, commercial email domains can’t be used to start accounts.  Readers here should be able to start free accounts at ConnectBeam to check it out with email addresses other than the big web mail names.  The first five users per domain are free and a tiered pricing system will start once an organization’s user base has grown beyond five.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/connectbeamscreen.jpg"" style=""float:left;""/>The ConnectBeam bookmarklet for adding a URL to your archive autopopulates all the requisite fields but also adds an image from the page, scrapes a summary of each page’s text and suggests tags.  Archive project pages can be commented on and you can search either in your own archive or company wide.</p>, <p>Gupta told me that ConnectBeam can also work as a private label solution for companies with large web sites filled with various products and information.  Most purchases are proceeded by online research and a bookmarking system allows potential customers to store and refer back to product and information pages later.  Perhaps more importantly for vendors, Gupta says, the system could provide valuable forecasting and supply chain data.</p>, <p>I find anecdotal discussions about the usefulness of social bookmarking in large organizations and business all the time, but most use either public consumer grade services or an ad-hoc system developed in-house.  I think that a vendor dedicated to providing this service has a lot of potential.  I asked Gupta why companies would employ the services of a startup instead of looking to large established vendors to add social bookmarking to their offerings.  He told me that startups have greater potential to be agile, disruptive and responsive.  That’s a big part of the Web 2.0 story and I’ll be interested to see if ConnectBeam can find success in making it reality.</p>]"

T-Mobile to Buy Roaming Partner SunCom Wireless,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""tmobile2.jpg"" height=""35""/>T-Mobile announced today that it will pay cash and assume the debt of SunCom Wireless, a company that T-Mobile is using as a roaming partner. The merger will cost T-Mobile $2.4 billion in cash and assumed debt. Under the agreement, sanctioned by both boards, SunCom shareholders will receive $27 per share. This purchase price represents 22.7% over the closing price of SunCom common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, September 14. Large shareholders like Highland Capital Management and Pardus Capital Management, who together own over 50% of SunCom’s issued common stock, have committed to vote in favor of the buyout.</p>, <p>SunCom has market share in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. SunCom operates a GSM/GPRS/EDGE network and has provided roaming service to T-Mobile in these markets since 2004. T-Mobile expects this acquisition to expand its U.S. nationwide coverage (excluding roaming) from 244 million potential customers to 259 million. T-Mobile also expects to realize synergies with a net present value of approximately $1 billion through reduced roaming and operating expenses. T-Mobile also hopes for growth in the newly acquired market areas.</p>, <p>Robert Dotson, president and chief executive officer of T-Mobile USA, said, “The strategic fit of the SunCom operations will make this a near-perfect acquisition. It will round out our domestic footprint, allowing us to serve 98 of the top 100 markets, and will significantly benefit our financial position by reducing roaming expense. Furthermore, it will add a talented group of employees that will enable us to serve more than one million new SunCom customers with industry-leading national products and services available under the T-Mobile brand.”</p>, <p>As mobile phone service starts to reach the saturation point in developed markets, it is only natural that companies will continue to merge as the competition for market share becomes more difficult. Cost cutting moves, like T-Mobile’s buying of a roaming partner, will make bottom lines blacker and services sleeker for customers. The downsides to such movers are a loss of jobs and the potential for less competition as fewer mobile phone providers control the airways and infrastructure that keeps us connected on-the-go.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.t-mobile.com/"">T-Mobile</a><br/>

The system offers low transaction costs for merchants and mediation between buyers and sellers online in exchange for access to what will be a huge amount of data about shopping and sales conversions.  There doesn’t appear to be many benefits for buyers in the system.</p>, <p>There are $10 discounts at many participating stores, but in order for me to welcome a new system like this into my life I need features that beat what’s already available.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""shot"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/googcheckoutsample.jpg"" style=""float:left;""/>Not a stored value system like PayPal, Google Checkout is more like a unified shopping identity for buyers who can give their credit card number to just one company (Google) and limit email contact received later from places they shop online.  I’m not sure how much I trust Google at all and I’d need a more compelling feature set in order to give them this information (I use GMail because it’s a great system).  I hope that stores will offer both PayPal and Google Checkout services, though it seems very unlikely.</p>, <p>The Google Checkout site is in its infancy, with only about 100 stores listed as participating at the program’s inception and few variant URLs that redirect yet to the program page.  The program, though high profile in the media, is described on its page almost entirely in terms of its benefits to sellers. The system is limited to sellers in the US, many people were hoping that it would be available in more countries than PayPal is.</p>, <p>AdWords participants will gain extra benefits, with a $10 in sales processed at no cost  for every $1 they spend on advertising with Google.    Transaction fees are remarkably low, roughly 2/3 of PayPal’s basic rates.</p>, <p>The service’s pricing structure may ultimately be profitable enough for Google, but the major strategy here could be to access shopping data.  The biggest question then appears to be whether consumers trust the Google brand enough to look to the company for more than just access to the rest of the world’s data, but as a repository for our own data kept private from a world of online shopping vendors.  The benefits over PayPal seem clear for sellers, but whether consumers will react favorably is my question.</p>, <p>I like having a store of money in my PayPal account and automating monthly subscription payments.  Neither of these appear to be an option with Google Checkout.  I don’t know why I’d use Google Checkout over PayPal if I had a choice, and if I don’t have a choice I’m liable to resent it.  Maybe someday all this data on my shopping habits will be used to better serve ads I’m interested in via Minority Report type billboards, Google style. I don’t know.</p>]"

Salesforce has now connected Twitter to the Service Cloud, allowing customer service reps using the SaaS to access tweets from more than 8 million Twitter users.</p>, <p>Salesforce’s CRM for Twitter allows enterprises to search for tweets about their companies, products and brands. Here’s how it works. First, Salesforce CRM searches within the Service Cloud for any tweets that are relevant to a company. Then, the company can capture and monitor the conversation, creating a database in the Service Cloud that keeps track of all subsequent conversations about the company. The Service Cloud also allows enterprises to tap into company-wide online communities, creates connections to existing social networks and the blogosphere, provides SEO tools, shares the social network knowledge with business partners, and integrates customer service operations into the cloud.</p>, <p>The Service Cloud seems like a useful tool to capture and then sort conversations about a particular enterprise. But what’s fascinating is how businesses want to tap into the dialogue of what’s happening on social networks, like Facebook and Twitter. Social networks are becoming much more than an online gathering of friends; Facebook and Twitter are becoming destinations for ideation, e-commerce and marketing.

iPhone Goes British on November 9,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""Apple-logo3.jpg"" height=""96""/>Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced today that the iPhone will be available to British customers on November 9 of this year. The O2 network has the exclusive carrier rights to the iPhone brand in the British Isles. As MobileCrunch reported last month, <a href=""http://mobilecrunch.com/index.php?s=apple+to+share+carriers+r"">Apple to Share Operators Revenue</a>, it is believed that other European carriers are working on exclusive licensing agreements for the iPhone brand.

Customers will have to sign an 18 month contract with O2. It wasn’t that long ago when Apple reduced the U.S. price of the iPhone from $599 to $399 a few weeks after its launch.

Google Adds Adsense to Mobile,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""googleadsense.jpg"" class=""right"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/googleadsense.jpg""/>It is everywhere… advertising, and escaping ads and marketing campaigns might just get a little harder. But this isn’t necessarily a bad thing either. Because, while Google may not have invented online advertising, its efforts certainly brought ads to sites that wouldn’t have otherwise been able to sell any sort of banner ads or generate other forms of revenue.</p>, <p>Now the mobile Web may begin to look a lot like the old Web. Google has announced the availability of AdSense for Mobile, a program that contextually targets ads to mobile Web site content. And there is money for those who serve up the ads too.

AdSense for Mobile will be available to mobile Web site publishers in 13 countries including the United States, England, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Ireland, Russia, The Netherlands, Australia, India, China and Japan.</p>, <p>How successful this will be, still remains to be seen. For one thing mobile Web users don’t just tend surf the way that users do on a PC. Mobile Web users look for very specific content, so the ads will need to be even more compelling to get users to click-thru. But for developing nations where PC penetration is small the mobile Web could be very enticing.

Mpire mines data from transactions on eBay, Craigslist, Yahoo and Overstock.com to display price trends and quantities of items searched for.  The buying guides are sponsored, stylized displays of that data in particular shopping niches.  Unfortunately, I don’t think they work very well.</p>, <p>Mpire is a 16 person company based in Seattle that just launched this month.  The team is interesting.  Matt Hulett, Chairman &amp; CEO, used to be the President of the corporate travel division at Expedia.  J. Richard Rock, former Senior Director of Business Development at eBay, is a primary investor.  Philip Rosedale, Founder and CEO of Linden Lab  (the home of Second Life) is an advisor.  With a team like that I can imagine that great things are possible.</p>, <p><img alt="""" class=""shot2"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/mpirescreen.jpg"" style=""float:right;""/>I like the price trend graphs that Mpire offers and if I refine my searches enough to exclude accessories related to my search terms then the data looks helpful.  These new sponsored buying guides don’t do that though.  One highlighted item, for example, is a Weber grill.  When I see it in the Mpire catalogue there’s a nice low average price listed, but when I click through I see eBay listings that include grill covers, replacement parts and other things that include the product name in the search results.  This makes the average price of the grill itself appear much lower than it actually is.</p>, <p>The company says that Mpire provides helpful data on real market value for items bought online.  That may be true for some items, but I don’t think it works with these buying guides.  In my conversation with the company, Styx concert t-shirts were a favorite example.  I imagine that the real market value of obscure items are well delivered by Mpire, but I’m not so sure about the kind of very general search terms highlighted in these sponsored buying guides.</p>, <p>Search results are also dominated by eBay auctions because low prices are what’s prioritized.  Craigslist results aren’t integrated in the page, they just have a simple interface for performing your search in Craigslist.</p>, <p>The idea here is a good one and it is useful if I really roll up my sleeves and refine my searches a number of times or if I’m searching for an item that’s relatively straightforward.  Trying to fashion a catalogue out of search results is a tough thing to do though.  Keeping the interface simple relative to some complicated data is a real challenge as well, I imagine.  Overall I like the idea but I think the implementation leaves a fair bit to be desired.</p>]"

Myxer Works with AmieStreet on Ringtones,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""amiestreet.JPG"" height=""42""/>Myxer has been at this weeks TechCrunch conference (the flagship of all the Crunches) showing its wares, when it announced yesterday that Myxer has been hired by AmieStreet to create and distribute mobile ringtones. The Myxer platform simplifies the delivery of any professional or user-generated content (including ringtones, images, audio and video) to mobile devices, no matter which carrier or network the phone is on.</p>, <p>You may be thinking, “So what, there are millions of ringtone providers.” But AmieStreet has a unique pricing angle. While most commercial ringtones are sold at a set price, AmieStreet uses a sliding scale based on the popularity of the ringtones. The price starts at 0, and as a ringtone increases in popularity the price goes up, until it maxes out at $1.99. This creates word-of-mouth advertising for new releases, and bragging rights for the people who get a popular ringtone for free. In effect, the customers drive the discovery, promotion and pricing of music. The first ringtone is “Walk Wit A Limp” by hip hop master Romeo.</p>, <p>“Myxer is making the content world mobile, and by powering AmieStreet’s ringtone offering, we are able to show how quickly and easily that can be done,” said Myk Willis, founder and chief technology officer of Myxer.  “Just as Myxer has democratized mobile content distribution, so has AmieStreet democratized digital music and ringtone pricing – allowing the consumers full access to and control over the value of music.”</p>, <p>“When we decided to offer community-priced, a la carte ringtones, Myxer was the logical choice because of its simplicity and established product,” said AmieStreet’s co-CEO Elias Roman.  “We are now able to bring social music discovery to the exploding mobile market while staying focused on providing a music retail experience that is totally community-driven.”</p>, <p>This partnership should be good for artists who want to get their music out to a greater audience. All AmieStreet musicians will be able to sell ringtones from the artist store, where mp3s are also sold. Once an artist’s content is uploaded to AmieStreet, it is automatically available to the 2.5 million users who download mobile content from Myxertones.</p>, <p>There may be a million ringtone providers out there, but AmieStreet’s pricing structure could make a breach into a tough marketplace. It is similar to what professional musicians go though in a quest for platinum. You start out giving free concerts, and as you become more popular the band charges more money to perform at larger venues. By mimicking this evolution, AmieStreet has tapped into the competitive nature of listeners and performers.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.myxertones.com/default/"">Myxertones</a><br/>

One of The Consumerist’s readers, Sean, ordered an iPod from <a href=""www.smalldog.com"">smalldog.com</a>, and instead of finding an iPod in the middle of Apple’s big iPod box, he found two bars of Irish Spring soap, and a some Kirkwood batteries. I know what you’re thinking, “Soap doesn’t need batteries!”    Just kidding. Sean, who was pissed off at this point, immediately gave Smalldog a call. Here’s how the call went:</p>, <p>I was ready to really tear into someone when a supremely polite and nice customer service rep answered the phone. When I told her about my situation (and not too nicely, I might add), she started laughing. For a second I was shocked! I mean, first you screw up, and then you laugh at me!? But the next thing I knew, I started laughing too. She used just the right amount of humor and seriousness in helping me figure out what had happened.</p>, <p>In the end, she put in an order to have it inspected by UPS, and put another unit on hold for me, and gave me her direct line, informing me that the second UPS is done inspecting the package that I was to call her, and she would ship it right away. She also wanted to know if I took any pictures, saying that she’d love to have a few to show the other people in the office.</p>, <p>UPS showed up the next day, and right after they left, I gave her a call (she answered after two rings), and shipped the iPod overnight express. Needless to say, I was thrilled with the sophisticated level of customer service at Smalldog.<br/>
It was good to see that someone could have a sense of humor and still be incredibly accommodating at the same time.</p>, <p>I completely agree with Sean, it’s incredibly difficult to find good customer service these days, especially with odd problems like Sean’s.

"CouchSurfing Deletes Itself, Shuts Down","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.couchsurfing.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>This is just ridiculous. Three year old <a href=""http://www.couchsurfing.com"">CouchSurfing</a>, a beloved service used by some 90,000 members, had multiple database crashes, critical parts of the software and data were irretrievably lost, and the backups weren’t performed properly. They are not rebuilding the service. They literally put themselves out of business.</p>, <p>CouchSurfing allowed people to register their home and offer free accomodation to travelers. Creator Casey Fenton, sent the email below to all users of the service (I guess they didn’t lose that data at least).</p>, <p>
Dear CouchSurfers,</p>, <p>Two days ago CouchSurfing experienced what could be described as the perfect storm. The database administrators we hired made two critical mistakes. First, we had a major, avoidable hard drive crash. Secondly, the incremental back-ups weren’t executed in the correct manner, and twelve of our most important data files didn’t survive.</p>, <p>I have been working non-stop trying to repair the data, but as difficult as it is for me to say, it has become clear that certain essential pieces are not recoverable. This crash happened at a particularly vulnerable time, in a transition between two back-up methods. If the crash had happened a week ago, or next week, we would have had a different outcome.</p>, <p>It is with a heavy heart that I face the truth of this situation. CouchSurfing as we knew it doesn’t exist anymore. We’ve had an amazing two and a half years.</p>, <p>Members write “CouchSurfing has changed my life” and I know what they mean, it has certainly changed mine and I am eternally grateful.</p>, <p>My vision transformed. CouchSurfing was born out of a dream I had to meet the most interesting people in world and experience their cultures, and it grew into a living, thriving family of almost a hundred thousand. This community has blossomed in beautiful ways I hadn’t even anticipated. It was no longer about what I got to experience, but rather, what genuine, heartfelt good this community can offer the world. We have all opened not only our homes, but also our hearts, our lives. In sharing important moments, deep and meaningful connections have crossed oceans, continents and cultures. I saw in CS, in you, the power to change not only they way we travel, but change the world itself. Thank you, CouchSurfers. You have shown me more than I could have even known. Your generosity and spirit is a gift to humanity.</p>, <p>I have devoted the last three years of my life to CouchSurfing. I have literally poured every cent I have into the site. I’ve sacrificed my health, my time, and my own ability to travel and meet people. In many ways I’ve put my life and wanderlust on hold to build this network. I’m not complaining; it’s been a fantastic ride. As devastating as it is to consider, it looks like the ride is over.</p>, <p>Life is continuously changing, evolving, dying and being reborn. After a fire, the earth is replenished; after a storm, the air is cleared. It feels to me like this loss of CouchSurfing is how it’s meant to be. This crash is like a sign from the universe. Too many random factors aligned to make it as damaging as it is, and though I’ve tried everything I can and engaged the best and brightest database managers, there’s just no way to get it back. In many respects it’s heartbreaking, but at the same time, what we’ve built together is not dead, it lives on in each of us. It lives in the connections we’ve fostered and the culture we’ve created. I want us all to take this CouchSurfing spirit and continue the mission out in the world. We’ve all experienced this common vision and the potential it has to transform the way people relate to each other.

"Samsung to Dump WinMo, Symbian, Linux in Favor of Home Brew Smartphone OS!?","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img/>OK, we’re taking this with a grain of salt, but just a little tiny one. Our little birdie, who is in the know on smartphone OSes, sent us a tip concerning the idea that Samsung, the company responsible for many of the feature-rich yet slim phones across the country, is working on something totally new and totally awesome. So says the source, who goes on to assert that Samsung will be striking out on its own in the soon-to-be-red-hot smartphone market.</p>, <p>The real juicy bit here is that the tipster claims Samsung is dumping Windows Mobile, Symbian <em>and</em> Linux for its future smartphones. So what is it going to use? Its own OS. And a custom dual-core processor, with Java-on-a-chip. Even more, it’s planning on developing the mobile OS with an MPEG-based engine, built-in 3D acceleration and native Mp4 encoding and decoding. Ambitious task!</p>, <p>Of course any Internet rumor needs to be taken as just that: rumor. But that being said, our source has never let us down, so we have every reason to believe this is Sammy’s new strategy.</p>]"

"Ustream Launches Mobile Version of Watershed, Streaming Service For Enterprises","[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""shot2"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/watershed_logo.png""/></p>, <p>Live video startup <a href=""http://www.ustream.tv/"">Ustream</a> has launched the mobile version of <a href=""https://watershed.ustream.tv"">Watershed,</a> its broadcasting platform for enterprises.  Watershed Mobile will let organizations stream video onto a variety of mobile devices, including the Nokia N95 phones.</p>, <p>Launched <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2009/02/17/ustreamtv-launches-watershed-a-pay-as-you-go-live-streaming-service-for-enterprises/"">in February</a>, Watershed allows organizations to broadcast live video in minutes with their own private-label branding. Watershed Mobile will let organizations disseminate high quality video to a mobile phones via a fast streaming service. The service also includes integrated chat, GPS, and audience polling. The polling feature lets organizations ask their audience what they want to see or what actions they should take in a live broadcast situation.</p>, <p>Ustream has also signed on a few big-name businesses and universities to its Watershed streaming products, including Oracle, Duke, Sun Microsystems, UC Berkeley, and Sling. Watershed is helping create large-scale webcasts for these clients, with Oracle is considering using Watershed to broadcast from their annual worldwide events. Sun Microsystems is using Watershed for official earning calls and other internal webcasts.</p>, <p>The ability for businesses to stream live video onto mobile devices could be very useful, especially when Ustream integrates a variety of mobile devices into the platform. But as we’ve stated earlier, the price for Watershed’s  streaming service (mobile use is now integrated into these pricing options), a SaaS cloud computing service with pricing in a pay-as-you-go basis, isn’t cheap. Pricing starts at $1 per viewer hour for 1,000 viewer hours per month or less and scales down to $0.25 per viewer hour for streams that a reach 50,000 viewer hours per month or more. (A viewer hour is one viewer watching a stream for one hour, or 60 viewers watching for one minute, etc.). Ustream has also introduced monthly plans where businesses can pay a flat fee for viewer hours. For example, for 11,000 hours of viewing in a month, companies will pay $879 per month. Through either of these pricing models, mass streaming to thousands of people could be expensive. While a few thousand dollars is a drop in the bucket for big companies like Oracle and Sun Microsystems, smaller businesses may not be able to afford streaming video to a mass-scale, especially in thus economy. Mogulus also offer online video streaming for businesses, but hasn’t gone to the mobile space yet. Ustream has been making a big push into the mobile space and recently <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/2009/03/05/ustream-launches-mobile-video-broadcasting-apps/"">rolled out</a> its mobile video broadcasting apps.</p>, <p><img src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/watershed2.jpg""/><br/>

Nyko's Intercooler Causes Problems For Xbox 360,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""center"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/139947366245405b3ff1273.jpg""/></p>, <p>The Intercooler is a 3-fan venting system that attaches to the back of the Xbox 360, keeping the console cool and improving console performance. Seeing as how my Xbox 360 has never given me any problems (and it’s from the first batch of consoles), I haven’t gotten a chance to use the Intercooler myself, which turns out to be a good thing. Nyko’s Intercooler has been named a cause for Xbox 360’s “rings of death” (red lights that flash on your Xbox 360 console telling you that you’re screwed). Once these lights come on, owners usually have to contact Xbox support and send their consoles back in for repair.</p>, <p>Game World Industries contacted a couple different Microsoft customer service representatives to talk about the issue, both reps stated that the Intercooler causes problems for the Xbox 360. The first representatives stated that Nyko’s Intercooler drains too much power from the Xbox 360, which was manufactured with enough power to support only itself. The Intercooler drains a large amount of power when the console starts up, which causes certain components to not get the power they need to run correctly, which can then lead to the death of the console. The second rep stated that they had seen “scorch marks” on the console from the Intercooler – probably just dust. If you send in your Xbox 360 and these scorch marks are present, Microsoft will send you your console back untouched (The Intercooler is not a licensed Microsoft product). They did, however, recommend switching to Pelican’s fan stand, which connects to the console via USB.</p>, <p>When Aaron, from Gaming World Industries, bought the Intercooler himself to test out the product, it only worked for 2 months before it killed his Xbox 360. He called Nyko for an explanation, it stated that like most products on the market, the Intercooler has a small defect rate and is a reliable product. Now, no one really knows who to blame. Is Microsoft using the Nyko’s Intercooler as a scapegoat? Or is Nyko essentially responsible for Xbox 360 deaths? Perhaps, with the rise of the Wii, the point will be moot.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.gwn.com/articles/article.php/id/813/p/3/"">Nyko’s Intercooler Causes Problems For Xbox 360</a> [Gaming World Industries]</p>]"

PalTalk to offer massive multiperson video chat for social networks,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://www.paltalk.com"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" style=""float:left;""/></a><br/>
The video chat company <a href=""http://paltalk.com"" target=""_blank"">PalTalk</a> will go live on Monday with a new social networking service designed to be a proof of concept for the inclusion of video chat in social networks. PalTalk already has a thriving business in powering huge video chat rooms but the company believes their technology is the next logical step to create what they call Social Networking 3.0. If the first iteration was basic networking, 2.0 was layering richer self expression on the networks and 3.0 is real time video communication, they say. Makes sense to me.</p>, <p>PalTalk operates through a Windows desktop client and has already proven itself very scalable. It uses GAIM to create a consolidated buddy list across AIM, Yahoo Messenger and ICQ. The company says that its 4 million users often have 5,000 chat rooms open at any given time. The largest room they’ve had open at once included 3,000 people. Cringe-radio stars <a href=""http://www.opieandanthony.com/"" target=""_blank"">Opie and Anthony</a> use PalTalk for their chat room and regularly interact with between 1 and 2 thousand people at the same time. I asked the people behind PalTalk how that would be logistically feasible and they said there was a lot of hand-raising going on.</p>, <p>Monday’s launch of the social networking system, called People 2.0, will demonstrate the usefulness and feasibility of video chat in social networking, the company hopes. The technology will then be licensed anywhere that groups of people gather online. PalTalk’s technology is currently free to download, with a paid upgrade available but no prices or service level comparison easily discoverable.</p>, <p>The fact that there is no Mac version of PalTalk is a real shame and the company says that is one of their most frequent requests. The particular social networking implementation unveiled Monday is likely to be unimportant in its other features and details, but the company did tell me they were interested in pursuing open identity standards – for whatever that’s worth.</p>, <p>If social networking is really about more than just contacts between individuals and if people do want to connect in real time with a community of interest – then group video chat makes sense to me. Text chat in the social networking world is so anemic right now that I can imagine video chat setting the space on fire. Will people download desktop clients to access the function? Probably. Will they pay for it? Maybe, but licensees may offer it for free as well.</p>]"

But today editing a Web site for the mobile platform isn’t quite so easy as downloading a simple Web editor, or learning a few basic HTML tags. Part of the problem is that the mobile Web means that you’re not just coding for the PC or Mac, you have to consider dozens of constantly changing display sizes and make the pages easy enough to read and navigate on a very small screen.</p>, <p>This is where Wirenode comes in. This company provides a free mobile page editor, which even allows for the uploading of pictures and customization of your pages. The service is currently in beta, but users can register for the service to get coding. While the tools are clearly intended with everyone in mind, some basic HTML understanding will help.</p>, <p>But we’re pleased that the mobile Web isn’t going to have to leave out the little guy. After all, it was the little guy who made the Web what it is today.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.wirenode.com//"">Wirenode</a></p>]"
Yahoo! China faces new copyright law,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://cn.yahoo.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a>The International Federation for the Phonographic Industry, an organization with an antiquated name at the very least, has announced that <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&amp;sid=aZeZfAzpP.Ks"">it will file suit against Yahoo! China for copyright infringement</a> under a new law that came into effect in China this weekend.  The Federation says that around 90% of all music sold in China is pirated and Yahoo! China includes links to unaffiliated sites selling pirated music.  The whole thing leaves a terrible taste in my mouth.</p>, <p>When Yahoo! handed over information on a number of dissidents and reporters to the Chinese government, it said it was just following local laws.  Those individuals faced <a href=""http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=16402"">serious consequences</a>.  If international pressure is able to change Chinese law, those are the laws that should have been changed – not laws seeking to enforce a false scarcity over an ephemeral product like digital music.</p>, <p>When Google <a href=""http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&amp;ct=us/5-0&amp;fp=44a9bc6088b31c70&amp;ei=mSapRM-RDZigogL6icSgCQ&amp;url=http%3A//www.iht.com/articles/2006/06/28/business/lvmh.php&amp;cid=0"">lost its appeal in a French court last week</a> and was ruled guilty for including search results for counterfeit Louis Vuitton hand bags, most international observers thought it indicated an unrealistic and anti-American sentiment in France.  For some reason intellectual property infringement in music is taken far more seriously.  I hope people will think about the international politics at issue in the Yahoo! China case as well.</p>, <p>Specifically, it indicates a serious misplacement of priorities by US influence wielders.  Trying to change 90% of any practice seems like tilting at windmills to me, so I have a hard time believing that pressuring China to stop persecuting electronic dissidents isn’t happening because it’s unrealistic.  I think we all know why there aren’t serious resources invested in such a campaign – but I don’t know how much profit there was to be made in challenging apartheid South Africa, either.</p>, <p>Estimating damages from such practices in the developing world seems unrealistic, as it’s hard to imagine that most pirated goods would be bought at full market value if pirated alternatives were unavailable.  Having read about highly militarized raids on the producers of pirated movies in the developing world, tying this case into larger questions of IP law like drug patents (lobbyists tie them together) and thinking about that number – 90% – really makes me think that some other business model other than scarcity has got to emerge around fluid commodities like digital music.  For a good read on these topics, I recommend <a href=""http://www.powells.com/biblio?PID=28275&amp;cgi=product&amp;isbn=1565848047"">Information Feudalism: Who Owns the Knowledge Economy</a>.</p>, <p>Of all the laws to change in China, what a shame this is the one that international influence worked its power on.  What will Yahoo! Music do?  They weren’t willing to challenge Chinese law on human rights, will they do so when it comes to search results and listings?  If it makes sense for Yahoo! to change their practices in China, does it make sense for Google to change its practices in France?  What does this mean for search?</p>]"

No Contract Unlimited Calling from Sprint-Nextel?,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""sprintnextel1.jpg"" height=""76""/>Sprint’s chief executive Gary Forsee told a Goldman Sachs investor conference yesterday that Sprint is thinking about expanding the test area for an unlimited calling plan that doesn’t require customers to sign a contract. Customers pay a monthly fee for as long as the service is required or affordable. Rivals Leap Wireless and MetroPCS already offer commitment free unlimited calling plans.</p>, <p>People with poor credit are wary of signing contracts that lock them in to monthly payments for 12-24 months. Most unlimited calling plans require such a commitment. Sprint is hoping to add subscribers by enticing contract shy consumers with the bait of unlimited calling.</p>, <p>Plans offered by Rivals Leap and MetroPCS are limited to their coverage areas, which is in no way national in scope. Nextel has more national coverage in America and could make inroads into the less populated parts of the country, while competing in large markets. Mr. Forsee didn’t give any particularities about Sprint’s new venture, so you’ll have to keep reading MobileCrunch for updates.</p>, <p>Unlimited calling plans can be notorious for fees that consumers aren’t aware of because they don’t carefully read their contracts. This is also true with the unlimited plans offered by Rivals Leap Wireless and MetroPCS. For example, roaming minutes may be limited, which incur cost when calling outside the coverage area. Sprint can capitalize on the competition by pointing out its coverage is greater, reducing roaming costs.</p>, <p>Wireless providers like the accountable income stream that contracts provide. The largest providers may shun contract-less unlimited calling plans, keeping this as an enticement to commit to a long-term agreement. Since Sprint-Nextel is the #3 provider in the U.S., it is looking for divergent ways to increase its market share. No contract unlimited calling may be the gimmick that a cash strapped nation looks to for its mobile phone service in the future.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.sprint.com/index.html"">Sprint</a><br/>

MobileCrunch first mentioned the idea in October 2006, with the last update coming in May of this year, <a href=""http://mobilecrunch.com/index.php?s=barcode"">Pilot Program Launched for French Transit System</a>. The idea is scanning barcodes with your mobile phone camera and the company is Scanbuy.</p>, <p>Barcodes aren’t a new technology. The first barcode patent was granted in 1952. But it took a couple of decades before they became commercially affordable. By the 1980’s barcodes and the scanning equipment that reads them began to take the world by storm. Shipping and retail companies still utilize those ponderous symbols and numbers. With the advent of inexpensive mobile computing and picture taking, the barcode may show up in places that you wouldn’t expect.</p>, <p>The U.S. Air Force is making a 60 city promotional tour this year that uses Scanbuy technology. Barcodes are placed throughout the showcase that visitors can scan. The Air Force then sends text messages, sound, video or games to the scanner’s handset. The marketing potential and cost savings are easy to see.</p>, <p>The military often experiments with cutting-edge technology and new innovations. That whole Internet thing was set up by the Department of Defense in the 1960s. As the costs of technology lower and become available to the public, it is inevitable that the private sector will follow where the government has gone before.</p>, <p>The marketing and information potential of barcodes is only now being tapped into. Unless something else comes along, the future may find us scanning all types of things to get product information, promotional deals, or simple price checks. The way the mobile industry uses the old barcode is only limited by the human imagination.</p>, <p>Scanbuy isn’t the only company that offers this service. It just happened to come to my attention today. But I see the potential that this can bring to consumers, marketers and sellers. This is a service that may become so commonplace; my father will ask me to show him how to use the camera on his mobile phone.</p>, <p><a href=""http://scanbuy.com/index.php"">Scanbuy</a></p>]"

Tailgate on Your Mobile Phone,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img alt=""emdigo.jpg"" class=""left"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/emdigo.jpg""/>Emdigo announced that NFL Team Tailgate 3D is now available to Verizon Wireless and Alltel Communications customers. If you are a true football fanatic, Tailgate 3D is the application for you. Users can show the world that they aren’t just fair weather fans.</p>, <p>All 32 professional teams and their players are featured on Team Tailgate. Users can get their favorite players to perform videogame quality animations such as taunts, big hits and end zone celebrations whenever the phone is opened. Players will throw, catch and kick in a variety of 3D animations. New content and animations are downloaded automatically twice a month so the animation doesn’t become too repetitive.</p>, <p>Player cards with statistics and biography are accessible for every player. The entire NFL schedule is posted, with your team’s next game highlighted with 3D crashing helmets animation. Animated wallpapers and dialing skin can be setup that go beyond the initial screen and into the actual dialing interface.</p>, <p>“Football fans are truly passionate about their teams and favorite players,<br/>
so we’re delivering high-quality content that they can be proud to host on<br/>
their handsets,” said Emdigo President Steve Gleitsmann. “We’re honored that<br/>
both Verizon Wireless and Alltel Communications are recognizing the<br/>
uniqueness of Emdigo’s 3D phone screensavers by awarding NFL Team Tailgate a<br/>
coveted top deck position on their networks.”</p>, <p>If you are someone who likes to talk smack while wearing you team’s logo, NFL Team Tailgate 3D is the service for you. I don’t know why it took three weeks into the season for Verizon and Alltel to offer Tailgate 3D, but there is still time for 13 games and the playoffs for you to show the team colors. Although, if you are a Lions fan like me, a playoff spot feels hopeless after last Sunday’s crushing defeat to the Eagles. I wonder if Tailgate 3D has animations that include foreseeable interceptions, flaccid tackling and a secondary that camps out in lawn chairs? I can see it now, NFL Team Tailgate 3D Lions Addition, for teams that don’t talk trash, just get trashed.</p>, <p><img alt=""football-screen.jpg"" class=""center"" src=""http://old.mobilecrunch.com/wp-content/football-screen.jpg""/><br/>

Trimersion Head Mounted Display,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""center"" src=""https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/ctrimerscoolart2.jpg""/></p>, <p>The Trimersion Head Mounted Display is a virtual reality setup for FPS games on the PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. All you have to do is plug the adapter into your gaming peripheral and you’re good to go. No drivers needed for PC, and the adapters are supported for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Basically, the sensor tracks the HMD so when you move your head, your character moves its head. Same goes for when you fire the gun.</p>, <p>Since guns don’t really move in an FPS, holding one up to the screen can get annoying, so Trimersion also gives you the option of playing with the mouse. The HMD runs for a whopping $395, and only supports a short list of games which include <i>Halo, Halo 2, Counter Strike</i> and <i>Medal of Honor</i>. Since most of the games that are compatible with the HMD are old, it’s best to stay away from this extremely expensive product until it is at least compatible with next gen consoles, and more games.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.trimersion.com/product.cfm"">Trimersion Head Mounted Display</a> [product page]</p>]"
Follow the Mobile User,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><img class=""shot2"" src=""http://old.techcrunchit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/google-logo.jpg""/></p>, <p><em>This guest post is written by Vic Gundotra, Vice President of Engineering for Google’s mobile and developer products. (Prior to Google, he spent 15 years at Microsoft, most recently as their GM of Platform Evangelism.) Vic <a href=""http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/11/daddy-wheres-your-phone.html"">credits his now-7-year-old</a> with forecasting the importance of mobile data access, and now carries at least 4 phones at all times. Fortunately, he had two kids before adopting the possibly-prophylactic habit.</em></p>, <p><strong>Focus on the mobile user, and all else will follow</strong></p>, <p><em>Simpler data, better browsers, and a smoother experience</em></p>, <p>Today the mobile industry finds itself in a unique position to do right by its users:</p>, <p>Worldwide phone penetration continues to climb at a break-neck pace, with over 4 billion mobile subscribers at last count.<sup><a href=""#f1"">1</a></sup>  (In comparison, the PC industry is forecasted to see its sharpest unit decline in history.<sup><a href=""#f2"">2</a></sup>) Prevailing economic conditions will accelerate this trend, as users consolidate pricey communication services into cost-effective, all-in-one mobile devices.<sup><a href=""#f3"">3</a></sup>  And for the first time ever, half of all new connections to the internet will come from a phone in 2009.<sup><a href=""#f4"">4</a></sup></p>, <p>Google’s mobile traffic reflects these milestones — having quintupled since 2007<sup><a href=""#f5"">5</a></sup>  — and it underscores users’ appetite for mobile data services. But as a community of operators, device manufacturers and software providers, we continue to get in their way. In short, and as a general rule, we make it too costly, too unfamiliar, and too difficult to do anything beyond voice calls.</p>, <p>In reply I offer up three suggestions: simpler data plans, better web browsers, and a smoother on-device experience. And in each case I’ll use Google traffic numbers as a proxy for total internet usage and user happiness.</p>, <p><em>Disclaimer: As a Google employee using internal data to carry the weight of this article, I owe it to the reader to lay bare my economic incentives: the company I work for has a financial interest in the broad and sweeping adoption of the Internet-as-we-know-it. Indeed, more internet users leads to increased web usage, which often leads to more Google searches and downstream ad clicks. I use Google data because it’s what I know best, and because it reinforces my industry-facing remarks, but make no mistake: I’m fundamentally interested in what’s good for the mobile internet. It just so happens that this is also good for Google. With that said, I hope you’ll find value in the words and data that follow.</em></p>, <p><strong>Flat is the new phat</strong></p>, <p>Consider MetroPCS, a regional carrier in the United States with just over 5 million subscribers on their 2.5G CDMA network. Over the past year, their Google search volume grew over 2.5x more quickly than another global carrier with 10 times as many users, and a 3G network.<sup><a href=""#f6"">6</a></sup></p>, <p> <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/figure1full.png""><img src=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/figure1small.png""/></a><br/>
 Metro’s “secret” is a free month of web access at signup, with the option of flat-rate, unlimited data thereafter.<sup><a href=""#f7"">7</a></sup>  As a result nearly half of Metro’s subscribers use the web on a regular basis. (It’s also worth mentioning that MetroPCS was recently recognized for excellence in customer satisfaction.<sup><a href=""#f8"">8</a></sup>)</p>, <p>In contrast, many operators subject users to a labyrinthine set of data options, from pay-as-you-go to daily caps with significant overage charges. Now, can you imagine paying your at-home internet provider for every page load? Or needing to know the size of a website before visiting it? Or managing your monthly download quota across your entire household? It’s simply not practical, and it’s all the same internet, so why do we treat mobile users as second-class citizens? Case and point: my colleague’s January phone bill contained 27 pages of itemized data charges, spelled out in excruciating detail.<sup><a href=""#f9"">9</a></sup></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/figure2full.png""><img src=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/figure2small.png""/></a></p>, <p>Unless we declare flat the new phat — and soon — I fear Occam will do something terrible with his razor.</p>, <p><strong>They want it all, they want it now</strong></p>, <p>Users “get” the web, and they’ve known for over 10 years that the browser is the thing that takes you there. Likewise, more and more of today’s killer applications are the Amazons and Facebooks of the world, not software that you download to a local machine. So it should come as no surprise that mobile users want phones (and browsers) that put a fully-featured internet in their pocket.</p>, <p>For example: the availability of a modern web browser explains why iPhone and Android users — just 13% of the high-end market<sup><a href=""#f10"">10</a></sup> — represent nearly 50% of Google’s smartphone traffic worldwide.<sup><a href=""#f11"">11</a></sup></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/figure3full.png""><img src=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/figure3small.png""/></a><br/>
Similarly, users of the T-Mobile G1 and its newer WebKit browser search Google 20 times more often than Nokia Series 60 users.<sup><a href=""#f12"">12</a></sup></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/figure4full.png""><img src=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/figure4small.png""/></a><br/>
Both data indicate that it’s about usage — not just units — and this trend will continue unabated with more efficient JavaScript engines, and more sophisticated HTML5-compliant browsers.</p>, <p>The simple truth is that mobile users have wanted fast and full web access all along. Consider two quick facts about Google search behavior: the “tail” of PC and iPhone queries is significantly longer than that of feature phone queries;</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/figre5full.png""><img src=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/figure5small.png""/></a><br/>
 and the gap in query diversity between desktop and high-end mobile devices is shrinking.<sup><a href=""#f13"">13</a></sup>  People want all the world’s information on their most personal of personal computers, and we need to offer browsers that scratch this quintessential itch.</p>, <p>“One web will triumph.”<sup><a href=""#f14"">14</a></sup> Users want all of it. And they want it now.</p>, <p><strong>Friction is fugly</strong></p>, <p>In the early days of mobile search, customer feedback was clear: “I can’t find Google on my phone.” And in hindsight it makes sense: unintuitive device menus and preference panes mandated 20+ mind-numbing clicks just to locate portal content<sup><a href=""#f15"">15</a></sup> — nevermind “off net” sites like Google. This Frankenstein’s monster of OEM, carrier, and 3rd party software made it impossible to discover — much less enjoy — mobile data services, and showed a complete disregard for users’ on-device experience.</p>, <p>Thanks to an influx of smarter phones, many mobile users can now reach 3rd party software with a single tap or click. And in Google’s case, this desktop-like experience increases search traffic by many orders of multitude.<sup><a href=""#f16"">16</a></sup> <a href=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/figure6full.png""><img src=""http://www.beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/figure6small.png""/></a> Why? Because it provides a frictionless onramp to search results. Likewise, and prior to its v5.0 release in February 2009, Google Earth saw more activations on the day of its iPhone launch than any other day in the product’s history.  Why? Because the iPhone’s App Store and on-screen layout make it easy to find, try and access mobile data services.</p>, <p>And herein lies the rub: users appreciate well-written software, but ease of use and on-device navigability are critical preconditions for usage. (After all, if you hide a tree in a forest, who cares whether someone hears it fall? Chances are they’ll never find it anyway.) The proliferation of app stores is a positive step in this direction, as are efforts on the part of OEMs to give developers unfettered access to low-level functionality.</p>, <p>We have to surprise and delight users with fast and fluid interfaces. Friction is just fugly.</p>, <p>– Sent from my Android phone, with a WebKit browser and an unlimited data plan</p>]"
Google Books partners with Chinese publishers,"[<p id=""speakable-summary""><a href=""http://books.google.com""><img alt="""" style=""float:right;""/></a><a href=""http://books.google.com/"">Google Books</a>, a program that’s been controversial in the US, has reportedly penned a deal with four publishing houses in China.  Rival <a href=""http://baidu.com"">Baidu</a> has deals with Chinese libraries instead; its program has access to 15 million books, the largest online collection of Chinese books in the world.</p>, <p>Working with libraries is the approach Google came under fire for in the US when publishers said their copyrighted materiel was being included in the program without their permission.  The search company took an opt-out approach in the US. It’s notable that Windows Live Book Search has an opt-in program for publishers and Google appears to be following its lead when formulating its China strategy.  Google Book Search China will give readers acccess to excerpts from books and require payment to read the full works.</p>, <p>Though book search has not inspired a whole lot of interest in the US,  China’s long literary tradition may make this part of search more important there.  I don’t know how things work in China, but it seems that partnering with libraries instead of publishers would be the best way to access thousands of years worth of books.  Given all the lawsuits against US companies lately for failing to respect intellectual property in other countries, perhaps Google is taking a safe approach in China.</p>]"
